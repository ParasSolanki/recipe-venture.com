### Instructions

1. To begin with Broccoli And Aloo Lifafa Paratha Recipe, we will first make the dough ready.
1. Take a Mixing Bowl.
1. Mix 1 cup Vivatta Whole Wheat flour with water, oil and salt.
1. Add a little water at a time and keep on mixing it with your fingers till the dough reaches a soft consistency.
1. Once the dough becomes smooth and soft, cover and keep the dough aside for 30 minutes.
1. Meanwhile proceed to make the broccoli and potato stuffing.
1. To make the broccoli and potato  stuffing, in a Mixing Bowl and add the boiled and mashed potato, steamed and mashed broccoli, cumin seeds, garam masala, black pepper powder and freshly chopped coriander leaves.
1. Add salt to it.
1. Add lemon juice and mix all the ingredients well.
1. Keep it aside.
1. The broccoli and potato mixture is now ready.
1. In a small bowl, mix the cornflour and water to make a smooth paste.
1. Once the dove is well rested, make 6 small balls of equal size from the dough.
1. Sprinkle some dry flour on the rolling board and flatten the ball into a round shape using a rolling pin similar to making a roti.
1. Heat a Cast Iron Tawa and semi cook the flattened roti from both the sides.
1. Once fine bubbles start appearing on the roti, remove it from the tawa and spread good amount of broccoli and potato stuffing right at the center and spread it around leaving a little space from the sides to close the paratha into an envelope shape.
1. Once the broccoli and potato mixture is evenly spread, apply the  corn flour paste at the edges where the stuffing is not present.
1. Apply corn flour paste on the edges of the roti.
1. Fold the 2 opposite corners of the roti over the stuffing.
1. Now fold the remaining 2 edges sealing the filling well.
1. This will look like a folded envelope.
1. Place the stuffed broccoli paratha over hot tawa, drizzle oil or ghee and cook on both sides until they turn brown on both sides.
1. Using the same process, make the remaining parathas.
