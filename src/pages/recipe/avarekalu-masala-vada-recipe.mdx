### Instructions

1. To begin making the Avarekalu Masala Vada Recipe, wash the chana dal and soak it for an hour.
1. Wash the avarekalu and pressure cook for one whistle adding enough water.
1. Once pressure releases, drain the excess water and add the cooked field beans to a blender.
1. You can also add field beans as such without cooking but I prefer it cooking.
1. Drain the chana dal from water and add it to field beans in blender.
1. Add in  the dried red chillies too.
1. Grind together coarsely.
1. Field beans will mash easily and chana dal has to be slightly coarse.
1. You can also grind it separately.
1. Transfer into mixing bowl, add all the remaining ingredients - Gram Flour, Red Chilli powder, Fennel Seeds, chopped onions, finely chopped garlic, curry leaves, asafoetida and salt to taste.
1.  Mix well until combined.
1. The batter has to be thick so that the vadas can be shaped.
1. If the chana dal mixture is runny add some more gram flour to thicken it.
1. Heat oil for deep frying.
1. Check temperature by dropping small piece of batter.
1. If it rises to the immediately then the oil is ready for frying.
1. Take small ball of batter and flatten it between hands.
1. Drop it carefully into oil and fry in low flame turning both sides.
1. Fry in batches without crowding the oil.
1. Once it turns golden brown on all sides, remove from oil and drain excess oil in kitchen tissues.
1. Serve Avarekalu Masala Vada Recipe along with Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and Adrak Chai as an evening snack.
