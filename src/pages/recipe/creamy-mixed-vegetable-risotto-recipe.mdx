### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Onions - finely chopped.
- 3 tablespoons Fresh cream.
- Salt - to taste.
- Dried oregano - powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Creamy Mixed Vegetable Risotto recipe, into a pre heated heavy bottomed pan, add a teaspoon of butter.
1. To it add chopped onions and minced garlic.
1. Salute for about 3 to 5 minutes.
1. Once the onions have become soft add rice to it and mix.
1. Add some vegetable broth to it and bring it to boil.
1. Once they start boiling, reduce the heat and simmer till broth is completely absorbed.
1. Add the remaining stock and simmer until the rice is completely cooked and all the stock is absorbed.
1. If the stock dries up before the rice is cooked add little warm water .
1. Meanwhile, as rice is getting cooked, prepare the veggies.
1. In another pan, take a teaspoon of butter.
1. Throw in chopped coloured capsicums and mushroom.
1. Add a pinch of salt and pepper.
1. Saute in between till the veggies get nicely done.
1. I prefer to cook veggies on low flame so that they get nice crispiness and some nice grilled texture .
1. Once the rice is cooked stir in grated cheese, cream and mix till everything combines well.
1. Finally add roasted veggies, some crushed pepper and oregano powder give a gentle mix and serve hot creamy mixed vegetables Risotto.
1. Serve Creamy Mixed Vegetable Risotto along with Insalata Caprese Salad  for a weekend dinner with family.
