### Instructions

1. To begin making Matar Ki Tehri, wash and soak the rice in enough water for 1 hour before cooking.
1. Once it is soaked, drain the water and keep it aside.
1. Soak the peas in a cup of water, so that it cooks faster and retain some of that 'plump' look.
1. Heat ghee in the pressure cooker and add all the whole spices and red chilli and sauté it for 2 minutes on low flame.
1. After 2 minutes, add the sliced onions and ginger and sauté it on low flame for 2-3 minutes till they begin to brown.
1. Now add the tomatoes and peas and sauté it for another 2 minutes.
1. After 2 minutes, add coriander leaves, bay leaf and the rice.
1. Add salt according to your taste and mix it well.
1. Add water and cook on high flame till the pressure cooker releases 1 whistle.
1. Then simmer it down on low flame and let it cook for more 3-4 minutes.
1. Once it is done, turn off the stove and let the cooker release steam and open on its own so that the Tehari is nicely cooked.
1. Serve it hot, either on its own as a one pot meal or else with Lauki Raita, Beetroot Raita or any raita of your choice.
