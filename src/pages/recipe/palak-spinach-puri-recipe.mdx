### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Water.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera).
- 1 Green Chilli - chopped.
- 20 Spinach Leaves (Palak) - chopped.
- 2 tablespoon Sunflower Oil - more to deep fry.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/4 inch Ginger - peeled and chopped.

### Instructions

1. To begin with the Palak Puri Recipe, first chop spinach, ginger and green chilies and boil them together.
1. After boiling strain the water and leave it aside for 15 minutes till the water is drained.
1. After cooling, take the boiled contents from the strainer and add to a mixer and make a thin puree.
1. Do not add water, just make a puree.
1. Now in a mixing bowl add Vivatta whole wheat flour and the prepared pure, add some oil to the flour, cumin powder and salt.
1. Mix them to together to make dough.
1. Do not add excess water as palak will release water on its own.
1. Now cover the dough with a muslin cloth and keep it aside for 30 minutes.
1. After 30 minutes again, mould the dough and make small marble sized balls.
1. Make small balls out of the dough and dust the rolling table with whole wheat flour and flatten the puris with the rolling pin.
1. See to that you make small thick size round out of the dough.
1. As you have rolled all the dough now, heat a Kadai and add oil.
1. When oil gets heated, gently add a flattened puri.
1. Using a frying spoon or slotted spoon gently press the puri, put some hot oil on top and move in a circular way.
1. You will notice that the puri gets puffed and rises up.
1. At this point, turn it to the other side and fry till it turns golden brown.
1. Do not keep the puri in oil for more than 2 Minutes else it will become brittle.
1. Drain it on kitchen towel.
1. Continue the deep frying process for all the other flattened puris.
1. Serve Palak Puris with Lahori Aloo and any raita of your choice.
