### Instructions

1. To begin making the Goda Masala Recipe, first place a large pan/wok/kadai on a medium heat to roast all the ingredients.
1. When the kadai is moderately hot, with the heat on medium, gently and separately roast the ingredients listed under ‘To be roasted dry’ until they are fragrant and lightly browned.
1. Take care to keep the heat consistent and moderate so as not to burn any of the ingredients.
1. When each of the ingredients is roasted till aromatic, remove it in a separate container/wide plate and place it aside to cool.
1. Once that is done, proceed to roast the ingredients under “To be roasted in a little oil”.
1. Drizzle very little oil into the warm kadai and once again gently and separately roast the ingredients listed one by one.
1. You can club a few spices together such as the cloves, peppercorn, nagkesar etc.
1. Take them out in containers/wide plates and set them aside to cool.
1. Next, in a mixer-grinder, grind all the the dry roasted spices together in a batch.
1. Then grind all the ingredients roasted in oil together in another batch.
1. Ina large wide pan, mix the two batches of ground spices together.
1. Using a large spoon fold the mixture repeatedly so that the spices are uniformly blended.
1. Next, add in the chilli powder and salt.
1. If using turmeric powder add that too at this stage.
1. Mix well once again.
1. If you wish, you can once again place the mixed spices in the grinder and pulse once more to ensure perfect blend.
1. Empty the mixture into an airtight container and use it when making Maharashtrian Masale Baath, Dal Vangi and Moong Sprouts Usal.
