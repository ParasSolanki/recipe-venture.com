### Ingredients

- 500 grams All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1 tablespoon Milk.
- 1 cup Homemade Pizza And Pasta Sauce.
- 2 tablespoons Sugar.
- 1 tablespoon Butter.
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.
- 2 teaspoons Active dry yeast.
- 2 tablespoons Sunflower Oil.
- 200 ml Milk.
- 2 Whole Eggs.

### Instructions

1. To prepare French Brioche Recipe (Savoury Version), Pour Luke warm milk in a bowl, add sugar and yeast into the milk and mix well.
1. Leave it for 10 minutes until the mixture froths up to proof.
1. If it does not froth, discard the mixture and make a new batch again.
1. Break the eggs into another bowl and beat them lightly.
1. Set aside.
1. Mix flour and salt in a large mixing bowl.
1. Make a depression in the center, pour in the eggs, melted butter and yeast mixture.
1. Knead into smooth dough by adding additional water until pliable and soft.
1. Transfer the dough to a clean surface, dust little flour and knead for about 20 minutes until the dough is smooth and shiny.
1. Make a ball, and transfer to the same bowl in which you started, grease the bowl and the dough with olive oil.
1. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and leave it to prove for an hour or until the size of the dough is doubled in volume.
1. After the dough has risen to double the volume, Punch the dough and knead it again.
1. Divide the dough into 4 portions.
1. Take one of the portions and roll it into a circle that is 2mm thick like chapati.
1. I used a plate to cut the round shape from the dough, so all my 4 portions are equal in size.
1. Grease the baking tray with olive oil and place the rolled dough on the baking tray.
1. Spread pizza sauce on top of the rolled dough, leaving the edges.
1. Next take the second portion of the dough and roll it to the same size.
1. Lift the roll carefully and place it on top of the first layer.
1. Spread pizza sauce on top leaving the edges, like you did for the first layer.
1. Repeat step the same steps for two more layers.
1. Do not spread the pizza sauce on top of the 4th and final layer.
1. Place a very small bowl or the mouth of a glass at the center of the layers.
1. Using a sharp knife, slit the layers of dough sheets together into 4 (in a plus shape but leaving the center intact).
1. Next cut in between the 4 portions and make 8 divisions(in a plus shape but leaving the center intact).
1. Finally cut in between the 8 portions making 16 wedges throughout.
1. Like a braid, take two adjacent wedges and place each wedge on the opposite side and twist further till centre and form the petal in the centre.
1. Similarly braid every 2 adjacent wedges by twisting and making a flower formation at the end of the work.
1. Seal the edges when you are at the end of every braid twist.
1. Cover the flower with damp cloth and let it prove for another 30 minutes.
1. Brush milk over the dough very gently without putting pressure.
1. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 180 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the bottom edges are brown.
1. Place on wire rack and immediately brush with olive oil and let cool.
1. Beautiful French Brioche Recipe (Savoury Version) is ready.
1. Devour this yummy brioche for tea time snack or dinner.
