1. Check the salt and spice levels to adjust to suit your taste.
1. Heat the Kuzhi paniyaram Pan and add a drop of oil to coat the pan; once the pan is well heated scoop the vada batter using a scoop spoon.
1. Cover the pan and allow it to steam .
1. You will notice the top part of the vada getting cooked.
1. At this point you could add another drop of oil and then using a tiny flat spoon gently flip the vada so it can get cooked from the other side and crisp as well.
1. When you insert the back of the spoon or a knife in the center it should come out clean - this the test to check whether it is has been cooked.
1. Continue the same process with the remaining vada batter and enjoy the healthy version of the vada's.
