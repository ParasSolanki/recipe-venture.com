### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Jaggery.
- 4 Karela (Bitter Gourd/ Pavakkai).
- 2 sprig Curry leaves.
- Salt - to taste.
- 18 grams Tamarind.
- 5 tablespoons Coriander (Dhania) Seeds.
- 1 tablespoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).
- 1/2 tablespoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 2 tablespoons Coconut Oil.
- 2 teaspoons Mustard seeds.
- 3 tablespoon Mustard seeds.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Karathe Nonche Recipe, wash bitter gourds and cut into two lengthwise.
1. Remove seeds in the center and discard them.
1. Cut the deseeded bitter gourd into cubes.
1. Keep aside.
1. In a saucepan, roast coriander seeds, mustard seeds and methi seeds on medium low heat until the mustard seeds start to splutter and the whole mixture turns light brown; about 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Just before removing from heat, stir in asafoetida powder, give it a good mix and keep aside to cool.
1. The heat of the mixture is enough to roast the asafoetida powder.
1. Once the mixture is cool, blend it along with a small lemon sized piece of tamarind to a powder.
1. In a large deep saucepan, add plenty of water to the chopped bittergourds to up to 1 inch above the vegetable.
1. Bring to a boil on high heat and once it comes to a boil, lower heat, cover and cook on medium low heat until it is cooked and soft and almost done.
1. Once it is cooked, add the spice powder, jaggery and salt, mix well and bring to a boil again.
1. Once it comes to a boil, lower heat and simmer on medium low until the pickle becomes thick; about 15 to 20 minutes.
1. Do a taste test and adjust the jaggery and salt to get a balanced sweet and salty flavor with a slight tang of the tamarind.
1. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to a month.
1. Enjoy Karathe Nonche Recipe | Bitter Gourd Pickle with Steamed Rice and Lauki Chana Dal Recipe or along with any Indian flatbread like Sweet Potato Thepla/Paratha Recipe and a bowl of Homemade Yogurt (Curd).
