### Instructions

1. To begin making the Stuffed Capsicum Makhani Recipe, we will pressure cook the tomatoes in the pressure cooker with 1/4 cup water for at least 2 whistle.
1. Once done allow the pressure to release naturally and open the lid.
1. You will notice the skin has peeled, this shows that the tomatoes have cooked, carefully peel of the skin and chop them into big chunks and add into the mixer.
1. Also add the remaining water that was in the cooker also.
1. Blend to make a smooth puree and keep aside.
1. Make a paste of the cashew-nuts by blending along with a 2 to 3 tablespoons water and keep aside.
1. Make a paste of chopped onion, garlic, cumin seeds, dry red chillies and keep aside.
1. Cut the capsicum into 1 inch size rings and keep aside.
1. Remove any seeds and excess white skin.
1. In a mixing bowl, add crumbled paneer, boiled potatoes, chaat masala, garam masala, red chilli powder, pepper powder, salt and coriander leaves.
1. Give it a mix and the filling has to hold itself in order to stuff it inside the capsicum moulds.
1. Take a desired portion of the paneer mixture and stuff it inside the capsicum rings and flatten it.
1. Heat a flat non-stick pan, drizzle some oil and place the stuffed capsicum and cook on either side until the capsicum has cooked.
1. It will take about 5 minutes on either side or once done place the stuffed capsicum over a plate until you move on to make the makhani gravy.
1. Heat a kadai with oil, add in whole spice like cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf and allow it to sizzle for few seconds.
1. Add the onion paste and saute it for about a minute.
1. Sprinkle all the spice powders like red chilli powder, turmeric powder, garam masala salt and sugar and keep mixing.
1. This will help the raw smell go away from the onion ginger garlic paste.
1. Once the raw smell goes away, stir in the tomato puree and give it a stir.
1. Stir in the cashew nut and the fresh cream.
1. Cook on medium heat, covered with a lid for 10 minutes until the Makhani Gravy is well combined with the spices and the cream.
1. Give the Makhani a taste and adjust the salt and spices accordingly.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and transfer the Makhani gravy to a serving dish and place the stuffed capsicum over the gravy and drizzle some cream and serve warm.
1. Serve the Stuffed Capsicum Makhani Recipe along with Whole wheat Naan, Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita for an delicious Indian lunch or dinner.
