### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rajma Aloo Cutlet Recipe (Tikki/Patty),  we will first cook the rajma in the pressure cooker with enough water until very soft.
1. Once cooked, allow the rajma to cook completely and drain out the excess water.
1. You can use this water in a soup or cooking rice.
1. Mash the rajma along with boiled mashed potatoes, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, chopped green chili, salt, amchur powder, minced coriander leaves and besan.
1. You can use a food processor to make the process of mixing all of them together easier.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Grease your palms with oil and take small portions of the rajma patty mixture, flatten them to shape it into a circular disc.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining portions of the cutlet mixture.
1. The next step is to cook the Rajma Aloo Cutlet.
1. Preheat a skillet on medium heat.
1. Place a few Rajma Aloo Cutlets at a time, drizzle a little at a time and cook the cutlets evenly on both sides until crisp.
1. Serve the Rajma Aloo Cutlet as a tea time snack along with tomato ketchup or a chutney of your choice.
