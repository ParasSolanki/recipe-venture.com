### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Wheat Roasted Vegetable Pizza Pockets Recipe, first preheat the oven at 200 degrees C for 20 minutes.
1. Then, proceed to prep the vegetables for roasting.
1. In a bowl, combine together green and yellow zucchini, yellow and red pepper, onion, oregano, basil and liberally drizzle the olive oil.
1. Toss the veggies thoroughly until they are all well coated with the herbs and oil.
1. Pour them onto a lined baking sheet and spread them out evenly.
1. Season with sea salt and black pepper.
1. Place the sheet in the oven to roast, for 20 minutess.
1. When the vegetables are roasted, take them out and set aside to cool.
1. Then, mix a teaspoon full of chilli flakes into the roasted vegetables and keep it aside for later use.
1. To prepare the pizza dough warm together 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk.
1. It should be slightly warm, not scalding.
1. In a large bowl, add warm water milk mixture and sugar.
1. Mix well.
1. Add 1/2 cup of flour and instant yeast.
1. Mix to form a paste.
1. Cover with a cling film and keep it in a warm place for an hour.
1. The mixture will become frothy after an hour.
1. In the same bowl, add 3 tablespoon of olive oil, basil, oregano, salt, 3-1/2 cup flour, 1-1/2 cup of water.
1. Mix everything and start kneading the mixture until it comes together in to a manageable dough.
1. Once the mixture forms a dough, transfer it on a clean counter and knead the dough with the heels of your palm for 8 to 10 mins.
1. The dough will become soft, pliable and manageable.
1. Oil the dough and place it in a large bowl.
1. Cover with a cling wrap or damp kitchen towel and keep it in a warm place for 1-1/2 to 2 hours to rise.
1. The dough will double in size and rise during this time.
1. After that punch punch the dough down, transfer it on to the counter and knead it for another 2 to 3 mins.
1. If the dough is sticky, you can dust it with flour.
1. Divide the dough into six equal parts.
1. Take one part and roll it out into a disc of about 13 to 14 inches of diameter with the thickness of approximately 6 to 7 mm.
1. Now, depending upon the size and shape of the pizza pockets you prefer, cut out smaller circles from the rolled disc.
1. I preferred making them circles of 3 to 4 inches of diameter.
1. Take one cut circle, spread a teaspoon pizza sauce over it.
1. Place a teaspoon of roasted vegetables over the sauce and top with grated mozzarella.
1. Sprinkle little Italian seasoning on top.
1. The sauce, stuffing and cheese quantity will vary based on the size and shape of pocket you choose but remember to do it just right, do not overfill or under fill it.
1. Please ensure that you place the filling in the centre such that you leave 1 cm space at the edges to fold.
1. Place another cut circle on top of the stuffing such that it is completely covered and press the edges to seal it well either using a fork or twist with fingers to form a pattern.
1. Gently snip a small hole on the top to allow the steam from the filling to flow out when baked.
1. Make all the pockets in the same way.
1. Gently place these prepared pizza pockets on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
1. When the dough is finished, bake these pockets in a pre-heated oven at 200 degrees centigrade for 12-15 mins or until they are light golden brown and baked well.
1. Take them out of the oven and serve warm.
1. Serve the Whole Wheat Roasted Vegetable Pizza Pockets along with other appetisers such as Mustard Mayo Baby Potatoes and KFC Style Crispy Chicken Popcorn for your house parties with a glass of wine or chilled beer.
