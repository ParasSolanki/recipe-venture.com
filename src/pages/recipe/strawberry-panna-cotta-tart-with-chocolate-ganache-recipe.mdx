### Instructions

1. To begin making Strawberry Panna Cotta Tart With Chocolate Ganache Recipe, first preheat your oven at 180°C to make the tart shell.
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine melted butter, powdered sugar and salt.
1. Mix well until all ingredients are combined.
1. Sift all purpose flour into the butter and sugar mix until the mixture looks like soft crumbly dough.
1. Using your palm and fingers, spread this dough evenly on the bottom and the sides of a tart pan with a removable base.
1. Use a tart shell with removable bottom as it is easy to remove the whole tart from it and hence making it easy to cut and serve.
1. Cover the tart shell with a cling film and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
1. Once done, prick the shell all over with a fork; this is done so that the tart shell does not rise while it gets baked.
1. Bake the tart shell at 180°C for around 20 mins or until golden brown.
1. Remove from the oven and keep it aside to cool down.
1. The next step is to make the Strawberry Panna Cotta.
1. Chop the strawberries and blend them in a blender to make a fine puree.
1. It will yield approximately 1 cup of strawberry puree.
1. In a pan, take 1/4 cup of water and sprinkle the gelatin over it.
1. Keep it aside for 10 minutes.
1. The gelatine will bloom.
1. Whisk the cream and sugar until smooth and form stiff peaks.
1. Fold the gelatin and the strawberry puree into the cream mixture until well combine.
1. Take care not to overbeat the mixture.
1. Pour the strawberry Panna Cotta into chilled tart shell and keep it in the freezer to set for at least 2 to 3 hours.
1. Once set, you can pour the chocolate Ganache we make below to the tart.
1. Next, for the Chocolate Ganache.
1. Chop the dark chocolate into small pieces, add it into the saucepan.
1. Add cream to the chocolate and place it over a double boiler.
1. Keep stirring it until the chocolate ganache becomes nice and smooth.
1. Allow it to cool a bit.
1. Spread the Chocolate Ganache immediately over the strawberry panna cotta layer and give it a swirl so that the ganache spreads evenly.
1. Keep the Strawberry Panna Cotta Tart Recipe in refrigerator to set for at least 2 hours before serving.
1. Garnish the Strawberry Panna Cotta Tart with fresh strawberries, chopped almonds and pistachiosServe Strawberry Panna Cotta Tart With Chocolate Ganache as a dessert after a Sunday Night Italian feast of Spaghetti Aglio Olio With Parmesan & Greens Recipe and Whole Wheat Focaccia Bread.
