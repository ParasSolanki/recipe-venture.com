### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Wheat Methi Puri Recipe, combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the ghee as well into the flour mixture and you will notice it will form a crumb like texture.
1. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. You can optionally add chilli powder or crushed black pepper to add to the spice.
1. Gradually add little water at a time and knead to make a firm yet smooth dough.
1. It should be more firm than the roti dough.
1. Preheat the oven to 180 C.
1. Dust the baking sheets with flour and keep aside.
1. Next, roll the  Methi Puri (Mathri) Dough into a large circle, using a circular cookie cutter, cut the puris into circles.
1. At home we like our puris to be on the thinner side.
1. So based on your personal preference, adjust the thickness of the puris.
1. Arrange the cut methi puris on the dusted baking tray and place it in the preheated oven to bake until golden brown and crisp (about 10 to 12 minutes)Once done, allow the Baked Methi Puris (Mathris) to cool down before storing it in airtight containers.
1. Serve the Baked Methi Puris (Mathris) as a tea time snack or pack into the school snack boxes for kids topped with cheese.
