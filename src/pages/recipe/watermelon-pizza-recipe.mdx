### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Balsamic Vinegar.
- Salt - a pinch.
- 1/4 cup Basil leaves.
- 1/2 cup Feta Cheese - crumbled.
- 1 Watermelon.
- 1/4 cup Black olives - sliced.
- Parsley leaves - as required chopped for garnish.
- 1 tablespoon Honey.
- 1 Onion - thinly sliced.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Watermelon Pizza recipe, wash the watermelon and wipe dry.
1. With the help of a sharp knife, cut half inch thin round slices horizontally from the part which is wider to resemble a pizza crust.
1. Simply garnish these pizza slices with a sprinkle of sliced onions, black olives, fresh basil leaves, crumbled cheese (I have used processed cheese but Feta is preferable) and a sprinkle of parsley.
1. Heat honey in a small skillet and add balsamic vinegar.
1. Cook on low heat till it thickens a bit (not too much otherwise it will be sticky and unusable).
1. Drizzle this reduction on the pizza slices once cold.
1. Cut and serve chilled.
1. Serve Watermelon Pizza for your evening snacks or tea parties along with some other snacks such as Iyengar Style Masala Toast and Salted Caramel Popcorn.
