### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Wheat Vegetarian Stromboli Recipe, preheat the oven to 180 C.
1. Grease a large baking sheet and place it inside the oven.
1. Method for preparing the doughIn a large mixing bowl, combine the water, yeast, sugar, and 1 tablespoon oil and stir to combine.
1. Let sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.
1. Sift the flour and salt.
1. Using your hands keep adding flour and salt to the yeast mixture until all the flour is incorporated but the dough is still slightly sticky.
1. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for another 5 to 10 minutes adding a little more olive oil if too sticky.
1. Coat the large bowl with a little olive oil and place the kneaded dough inside and over with a loose fitting lid or a plastic wrap.
1. Allow the dough to rest in a warm place for about 2 hours until the dough is nearly doubled in size.
1. To Make The StuffingHeat oil in a pan and stir fry the onions, red peppers and mushrooms with a little salt and pepper on high heat until lightly roasted.
1. Allow the mixture to cool and stir in the olives.
1. Prepare a thick flavoured tomato basil sauce using any of the recipes from the link.
1. Just make sure your sauce is not too liquidy, it should be thick, else your stromboli will turn to be soggy.
1. Punch down the dough and divide into two portions.
1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the dough to a large rectangle, about 10 by 14 inches.
1. Spread the tomato sauce over the rolled out dough.
1. Now sprinkle half the roasted mushroom mixture and half of the cheese leaving 1 inch border around the sides.
1. Starting from the end facing you roll up the dough into a cylinder, pinching the edges to seal.
1. Apply some water on the edges to seal well.
1. Repeat the process with the remaining dough portion and filling ingredients.
1. Place both the prepared stromboli's on to the baking sheet and allow it to rise for another 30 minutes.
1. Brush the top of each stromboli with egg wash or honey.
1. Sprinkle the sesame seeds evenly on the top.
1. Place it inside the preheated oven and bake until completely golden brown and starting to crisp, about 20 to 25 minutes minutes.
1. Turn off the heat and remove the stromboli from the oven and allow it to rest outside for 10 minutes.
1. When you are ready cut into thick slices and serve with Italian Style Potato And Cucumber Salad Recipe and Apple Crumble Pie Recipe.
