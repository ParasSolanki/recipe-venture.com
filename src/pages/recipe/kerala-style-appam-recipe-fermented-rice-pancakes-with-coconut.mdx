### Ingredients

- 2 cups Rice - raw .
- Salt - to taste.
- 2 tablespoons Sugar.
- 1 cup Fresh coconut - freshly grated.
- 1 cup Cooked rice.
- 1 teaspoon Active dry yeast -  + 1/2 cup of luke warm water.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kerala Style Appam Recipe, we need to first soak the rice in water for at least 3 to 4 hours.
1. Next combine the salt, sugar and yeast in the warm water and allow it to proof for 5 minutes.
1. I used an instant dry yeast, a variety that does not need proofing, hence I add it directly to the Appam batter.
1. Grind the soaked rice, cooked rice and coconut, adding just a little water and salt to make a thick batter.
1. Add in the proofed yeast to the batter and stir well to combine.
1. Transfer the Appam batter to a bowl.
1. Cover the bowl and allow it to ferment for 5 to 6 hours or overnight.
1. Adjust the consistency of the fermented Appam batter, adding water a little at a time to make it of thick pouring consistency.
1. If you make it too watery, then the Appams will not be as soft and will not spread well.
1. Preheat the Appachetty or the Appam pan on medium high heat.
1. Pour a ladle of batter on the Appachetty and swirl the pan in circular fashion to spread the batter.
1. The batter will be thick in the center and thin on the sides.
1. Cover the pan with a lid for approximately 2 minutes until it is crisped and golden brown on the sides and the centre is steamed and cooked.
1. Serve the Kerala Appams along with Kadala Curry or Kerala Style Vegetable Stew.
