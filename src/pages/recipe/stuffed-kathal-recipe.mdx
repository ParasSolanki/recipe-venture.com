### Instructions

1. To begin making the Stuffed Kathal,  let us first cut the raw jackfruit.
1. In order to do that we have to first, grease our hands and the knife that we are going to use, with some oil.
1. This important tip ensures that the hands don't get sticky from the natural fruit latex/sap present in the fruit does not get onto your hands and makes the cutting process hassle-free.
1. Keep a bowl of water mixed with some salt, ready to put the cut raw jackfruit pieces to avoid discolouration of the fruit.
1. Now that your hands and knife are well greased, cut the the jackfruit in half, discard the skin and start making 1 inch pieces and soak them in the salted water.
1. Place the jackfruit in a pressure cooker with 1/4 cup of water and pressure cook for 1 whistle and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Drain any water from the jackfruit and set aside.
1. Heat mustard oil in a pan on medium heat, shallow fry until crisp.
1. This will take about 5-7 minutes.
1. Drain on an absorbent paper and set aside.
1. In a pan, heat garlic butter on low heat, add fennel seeds and allow it to sizzle, next add the onions and fry till soft, for about 3 minutes.
1. Next add paneer and fry well.
1. Turn off the flame.
1. Stuffing for the stuffed kathal is ready.
1. Take Kathal pieces and stuff the jackfruits with the onion-paneer stuffing.
1. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the stuffed kathal, give it a quick mix and let it rest for an hour while the flavours infuse.
1. Meanwhile, to prepare the gravy.
1. Heat oil in a pan, on medium heat, add onions and saute for a couple of minutes.
1. Once thee onions are transparent, add tomatoes and give it a good mix, cover and cook until mushy, this will take about 3-4 minutes.
1. turn off the flame.
1. Once the onion-tomato cools down, grind it in a mixer to a coarse paste.
1. Heat a kadai on medium flame, transfer the coarse tomato-onion mixture and add chilli powder, garam masala and turmeric powder, curd and saute till the masala is cooked well and comes together.
1. Adjust spices and salt according to your taste.
1. Once done, pour this thick masala in an Oven Safe Bowl.
1. Put in the stuffed Kathal/jackfruit.
