### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Fresh coconut - grated.
- 1 cup Sugar.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2 cups Pistachios.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pista Burfi Recipe, soak the pistachios in warm water for about half an hour.
1. Once soaked, drain the water and blend the pistachios along with the coconut in the blender until you can a almost smooth burfi mixture.
1. Keep the mixture aside.
1. The next step is to make the syrup for the burfi.
1. In a medium size sauce pan; stir in the sugar and 1/4 cup water with heat on medium.
1. Once the sugar has melted continue to boil the sugar mixture until the liquid reaches a two string consistency.
1. To know the right consistency - do the cold water candy test.
1. Take few tablespoons of water in a cup; add a drop of sugar syrup to water.
1. If it holds its shape like a softball and doesn’t dissolve into water then it’s at the right consistency.
1. Once the sugar syrup has reached the right consistency, add the ground pista and coconut mixture, the cardamom powder to the sugar syrup.
1. With the heat on medium continue stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan.
1. In 10 to 15 minutes, the pista burfi mixture will thicken and will come away from the sides of the pan.
1. This happens with the coconut and pista releasing its oil.
1. At this stage turn off the heat and be careful not to stir any longer on heat as the mixture can get over cooked and will not set to the consistency required.
1. The sugar will crystallize making the burfi very hard.
1. Transfer the mixture on a greased square pan and spread it evenly on the top and press it down so its sets well.
1. Allow the pista burfi to cool completely.
1. Once cooled, cut the Pista Burfi into squares and serve.
1. You can make the Pista Burfi as a dessert when you have guests at home or make for festivals like Holi, Diwali and Raksha Bandhan.
1. You can also serve it after your delicious meal of Dal Makhani, Aloo Bhindi Sabzi, Palak Raita, Phulka and Jeera Rice.
