### Ingredients

- 250 grams Dark chocolate - like Bournville and fine chopped.
- 3 tablespoons Flax seed powder (flax meal).
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 120 grams Brown Sugar (Demerara Sugar).
- 50 grams Walnuts - chopped.
- 50 grams Cocoa Powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rich Chocolate Brownies, we will first preheat the oven to 165 C and grease and flour a square baking dishTo Make Flax Meal Egg Replacer If your recipe asks for 3 eggs, measure 9 tablespoons of flax meal along with 6 tablespoons of water.
1. Stir well and let the mixture rest for about 15 minutes.
1. This process of resting helps the flax meal mixture develop a gelatinous consistency similar to eggs.
1. To make the Batter Place the rich dark chocolate and butter (oil) in a saucepan over low heat and stir until smooth and all the chocolate has melted.
1.  Allow the chocolate to cool slightlyIn a large bowl, whisk together the sugar and Flax Eggs (eggs) until fluffy.
1. Gradually add the flour, cocoa and baking powder and fold in the chocolate mixture and whisk well until well combined.
1. You will notice the mixture thicken due the the warmth of the chocolate.
1. At this point pour the brownie mixture into the prepared baking dish.
1. Place the brownie batter into the oven and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes or until when a tooth pick inserted inside comes out clean.
1. Well, almost clean.
1. Brownies are most often moist and hence will have a few wet crumbs, but not a raw batter.
1. Remove from the oven, allow the Rich Chocolate Brownies to rest for 15 minutes before serving.
