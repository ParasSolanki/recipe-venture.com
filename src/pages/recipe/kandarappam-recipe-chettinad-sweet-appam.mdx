### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup White Urad Dal (Split).
- 2 tablespoon Arhar dal (Split Toor Dal).
- 2 tablespoon Yellow Moong Dal (Split).
- 1/2 cup Fresh coconut - grated.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1 cup Rice.
- 1 cup Cooked rice - parboiled.
- 1 1/2 - 2 cups Jaggery - grated.
- Water - required for grinding.
- pinch Salt.
- 2 tablespoon Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal).

### Instructions

1. To prepare Kandarappam Recipe (Chettinad Sweet Appam), soak rice and dals separately in water for about 4 hours.
1. Drain the excess water and grind into a fine paste adding required amount of water in a mixer.
1. Add grated Jaggery and coconut and grind into a batter.
1. The batter should have the consistency similar to dosa batter.
1. Now, add cardamom powder and salt to the batter and combine them well.
1. Refrigerate the batter for about 30 minutes.
1. This helps us while pouring the batter into oil directly.
1. This ensures that the appam has proper edges.
1. Meanwhile, heat oil in a Kadai over medium heat.
1. Once the oil is hot, take batter in a small serving spoon and pour the batter directly into the oil.
1. Once the appam comes up, pour hot oil over the top layer of appam using a ladle.
1. This enables fast cooking and helps us to get puffed appam.
1. Fry until the appam becomes light brownish flipping through the half way.
1. Appam cooks fastly and darkens soon.
1. Ensure they are removed from the flame once it turns light brownish.
1. Repeat the same for the remaining batter.
1. Serve Kandarappam (Appam) warmly on festive occasion and celebrate life with authentic Chettinad sweet.
