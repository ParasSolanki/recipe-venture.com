- 2 tablespoons Water.
- 1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 2 tablespoons Honey.
- 1/4 teaspoon Baking powder.
- 1 tablespoon Sesame seeds (Til seeds) - white.
- All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- Sunflower Oil - to deep fry.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chinese Darsaan Recipe With Ice Cream, we will first make the dough for the honey tossed flat noodles.
1. To make the Flat Noodles In a mixing bowl, combine the all purpose flour, with the baking powder, and oil, using just enough water, make a smooth soft dough.
1. Once the dough is ready, divide into equal portions of lemon sized balls.
1. Dust each of those dough balls with flour and roll out like a roti using a rolling pin.
1. Using a paring knife, cut long strips of the dough measuring 1 centimeter size, resembling flat noodles.
1. Heat a saucepan with water on medium flame, along with a teaspoon of oil and bring to a boil.
1. Once the water has come to a rolling boil, reduce the flame and gently put the noodle strips in.
1. Boil for about 2-3 minutes.
1. Once the noodles, tend to fluff up, remove from the water, using a slotted spoon and put it into a strainer that's resting on a bowl, to hold the excess water.
1. Do this for all the strips of dough and set aside.
1. Heat a kadai with oil on medium-high heat, gradually add in the boiled noodles, reduce the flame to medium-low and fry ensuring the noodles are cooked and it doesn't get the brown colour.
1. We need our noodles to be crispy, yet be pale in colour and not deep brown.
1. Remove the noodles from the kadai and place it on an absorbent paper to drain out the excess oil.
1. Allow it to cool.
1. To make the Honey Syrup In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, water and honey and bring to a single boil on medium-high flame.
1. Turn off the flame, add the roasted sesame seeds and give it a good mix.
1. Allow this honey syrup to cool down only until it is warm, toss it in the freshly fried noodles until well coated.
1. This is the Darsaan ! Serve the Darsaan with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
1. Serve Chinese Darsaan Recipe with Ice Cream as dessert after a meal of Dragon Chicken Sizzler Recipe or Sweet and Sour Vegetable Recipe with Tofu & Brown Rice.
