1. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.

1. To a mixer or a food processor, add the cooked beetroot and cooked chickpeas along with coriander powder, cumin powder, red chilli powder, garam masala powder, dry mango powder (amchur powder), asafoetida and salt as per your taste.
1. Grind this mixture to a smooth paste without adding any water.
