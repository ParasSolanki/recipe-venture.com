### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Wheat Vegetable Chilla (Cheela) Recipe, in a mixing bowl, mix the Vivatta Whole Wheat Flour and water and make a thick lump free batter.
1. The paste should be thicker than dosa batter.
1. After making a batter, mix the vegetables like chopped onion, chopped tomatoes, chopped capsicum, chopped coriander leaves,cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder and salt to taste.
1. Mix well.
1. Heat a tava and grease it with 1 tablespoon oil.
1. When the oil gets heated, add one ladle full of batter on the heated tava.
1. If the vegetables accumulate in the center, then using your finger tips spread the vegetables around the cheela.
1. Cover the tava with a lid for 3 to 4 minutes and cook the wheat chilla over medium heat.
1. The steam that gets created will help cook the chilla evenly.
1. Open the lid and spread 1 teaspoon oil on top of the chilla while it is frying on the tava and continue to cook until you notice the sides and the bottom of the chilla is cooked through and lightly browned.
1. Flip to the other side and let it get cooked for a few more minutes or until the edges appear crispy.
1. Serve the Whole Wheat Vegetable Chilla (Cheela) along with Peanut Chutney for breakfast, tea time snack or dinner.
