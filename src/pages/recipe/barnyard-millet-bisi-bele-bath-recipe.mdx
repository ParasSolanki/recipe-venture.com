1. Stir all the ingredients well.
1. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight and allow the vegetables to cook until you hear at least 2 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Since the vegetables cook very quickly, we will release the pressure by running cold water over the pressure cooker.

1. The millets and the rice continue to cook in this resting period, hence wait for the pressure to release completely.
1. While we are waiting for the pressure to release, Lets proceed to make the seasoning.
1. Heat a small pan on medium heat.
1. Add in a tablespoon of ghee and allow it to melt.
1. Add in the mustard seeds, the cumin seeds.
1. Allow it to crackle.
1. Then add in the red chilli, curry leaves and roast them until the red chillies are browned lightly.
1. Stir to roast the ingredients well.
