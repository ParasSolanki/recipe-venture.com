### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Grain and Oat Buns Recipe (Healthy Dinner Rolls), in a small saucepan combine the soft butter, milk, and water.

1. Stir in the yeast and honey.
1. In the bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, oat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt.

1. Knead, until the dough comes together in a smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky ball.
1. If the bun dough is unbearably sticky, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time.
1. Avoid adding extra flour if possible, sticky is better than dense.

1. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
1. Turn the bun dough out onto a floured work surface and divide into the 9 rolls.
1. Form each piece into a smooth tight ball by stretching the corners around the bottom and rolling between your palm and the counter.
1. Grease an 8 by 8-inch baking dish.
1. Place each ball of the Whole Grain and Oat dough in the dish and cover with plastic wrap or a muslin cloth.
1. Let rise again until puffy, about 30 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
1. Take 1/4 cup of milk and brush over the rolls.
1. Sprinkle some oats and place it on the baking tray.
1. Bake the Whole Grain and Oat Buns for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden.
1. Once done, remove from the oven and serve warm.
