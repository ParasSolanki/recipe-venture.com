### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mushroom Pasada, first soak the pinch of saffron in 3 tablespoons of warm milk.
1. Set this aside to allow the saffron to infuse into the milk.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a pan; add the ginger, onion and garlic and stir fry until the onions are tender and soft.
1. Add the chopped tomatoes, chopped almonds and green chilies and saute until the tomatoes are cooked through and soft.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and allow the tomato mixture to cool.
1. Once cooled, add the mixture in a blender to get a smooth puree.
1. We now have the partial pasanda masala ready.
1. Next, thoroughly wash the mushrooms and drain them.
1. Slice the larger button mushrooms in half and retain the smaller ones to use whole.
1. In a heavy bottom pan, warm the butter.
1. Add the mushrooms to it and sauté on a high heat for 6-7 minutes.
1. The mushrooms will immediately release water.
1. Keep tossing them till the water has completely evaporated.
1. Take the mushrooms off the heat and keep aside.
1. In the same pan, heat a teaspoon of oil, and add the cumin seeds, cinnamon, bay leaf, and peppercorns.
1. Toss them for few seconds.
1. Next add the ground onion tomato paste and continue to sauté for 3-4 minutes.
1. Add the turmeric, red chilli powder, coriander powder and mix.
1. Cook the gravy for 4-5 minutes until you smell the aromas coming through.
1. Next, add the butter-sauteed mushrooms, salt and 3/4 cup of warm water.
1. Mix it all together and bring the gravy to a brisk boil.
1. Continue to simmer for 5 minutes until the Mushroom Pasanda curry has reached a desired consistency.
1. Lastly, top the gravy with sugar, garam masala powder, kasoori methi, saffron infused milk and cream.
1. Mix well and cook for another for another 3-4 minutes.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Serve the Mushroom Pasanda along with Naan or Tawa paratha or a simple Jeera Pulao.
