### Instructions

1. To begin making the Parsi mama cake, first and foremost, set the oven to preheat at 180 degrees C.
1. Then, grease and adequately dust a 7" pan and set it aside for later use.
1. Next, sieve together the all purpose flour, baking powder, salt, cardamom powder into a bowl and set aside.
1. In another mixing bowl, using a electric hand blender, whisk together crumbled mawa, butter and sugar for 4 to 5 minutes till the mixture is creamy, pale, light and fluffy.
1. To this mixture, add one egg at a time and whisk till well combined and smooth.
1. The next step is to add 1/3rd of the flour mixture and 1/3rd of the milk, alternatively and mix well between additions.
1. Repeat with remaining flour and milk until you get a smooth, pourable mixture.
1. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and even out the top.
1. Sprinkle the almond and pistachio flakes around the surface.
1. You can also sprinkle some additional cardamom powder for added flavour.
1. Place the tin in the preheated oven to bake for an hour or till a skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.
1. Remove the cake from the oven, allow it to cool and serve it at a tea party along with crunchy Pan Fried Onion Pakoras, Non-Fried Corn & Cheese Bites and Masala Chai.
