### Instructions

1. To begin making the Gajar Vadi, we will firsty make the vadi.
1. Wash, peel and grate the carrots in a bowl.
1. In the same mixing bowl, add gram flour, wheat flour, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder together and knead to make a firm, smooth dough by adding little water at a time.
1. Make a soft dough.
1. To shape the vadi, sprinkle a little water on the dough, if required and shape the dough into cylindrical rolls of about 6" length and 1" thickness.
1. Make sure to make the rolls tight enough so that they don't split in the water.
1. In a saucepan, add enough water to accommodate all the rolls.
1. Now slowly drop the rolls into the water and boil them for about 15-20 minutes on high heat.
1. This will help in the rolls/ vadi to cook through.
1. Once done, remove the rolls and allow it to rest for about few minutes and allow it cool completely.
1. Once cooled completely, cut the Gajar Vadis rolls into even sized slices or bite size pieces.
1. The next step is to temper the vadi.
1. Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a pan on medium flame, add mustard and cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.
1. Add in the asafoetida, curry leaves, green chillies and sesame seeds.
1. Stir well for about 30 seconds.
1. Add in the cooked Gajar Vadi into the seasoning and stir fry for about a minute.
1. Ensure the Vadis are well coated with the seasoning.
