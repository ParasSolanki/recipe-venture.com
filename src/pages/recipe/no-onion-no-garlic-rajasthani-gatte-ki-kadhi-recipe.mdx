### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rajasthani Gatte Ki Kadhi Recipe we will first make the gatte.
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for the gatta.
1. Add a few teaspoons of water at a time and knead to make a firm dough.
1. Knead well for about 5 minutes to make a very soft melt in the mouth gatta.
1. If you add more water and it does not shape into a dough, then you will have to add more gram flour and knead it well.
1. Roll the dough into a long cylinder and cut them into 1 inch discs.
1. The next step is to cook the gattas in boiling water.
1. In a large saucepan boil water until it comes to a brisk boil.
1. Once the water comes to a brisk boil, add the gattas into the water and boil until they comes floating to the top.
1. Once they come floating to the top, boil for another 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Drain the gattas and keep it aside, till we get the Kadhi ready.
1. To make the kadhi, in a saucepan, combine the yogurt, gram flour until it becomes a smooth paste.
1. Add 2-1/2 cups of water, asafoetida, turmeric powder and salt.
1. Stir well.
1. Bring the kadhi mixture to a boil.
1. While the kadhi is coming to a boil, keep whisking it until you get a very smooth kadhi.
1. You will notice that the yogurt will stop curdling when you keep whisking.
1. Turn the heat to low, add the bay leaves, cinnamon, red chili powder and simmer the kadhi for about 10 minutes until the kadhi turns slightly thick.
1. Add the cooked gattas at this stage and boil for a few more minutes.
1.  While the Gatte Ki kadhi is boiling, we will proceed to make the tadka for the kadhi.
1. Heat oil in a tadka pan, add the ghee and the remaining ingredients and allow them to crackle.
1. Once they crackle, turn off the heat and add the seasoning to the Gatte Ki Kadhi.
1. Serve the Gatte Ki Kadhi along with millet based rotis or along with steamed rice, Kachumber Salad and Boondi Raita.
