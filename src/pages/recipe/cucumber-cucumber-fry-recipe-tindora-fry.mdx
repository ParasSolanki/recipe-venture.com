### Instructions

1. To begin making the Dondakkai / Kovakkai Poriyal Recipe, we will first cut the Dondakkai / Kovakkai into the desired shape.
1. Place the cut Dondakkai / Kovakkai into a steamer, sprinkle some salt and steam on high heat until the vegetable is cooked through.
1. At home, we personally like the vegetables to have a slightly firm texture as opposed to something too soft and mushy.
1. Once the Kovakkai is steamed, turn off the heat and remove it from the steamer container and keep aside.
1. The next step is to season the vegetable.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a heavy bottomed pan on medium heat.
1. Add the mustard seeds and the halved urad dal.
1. Allow them to crackle and roast the urad dal until it is crisp and golden.
1. Once the dal is roasted, sprinkle the asafoetida, add the curry leaves and the steamed Kovakkai.
1. Stir well to combine the Kovakkai Poriyal.
1. Check the salt and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Finally, stir in the grated coconut and give it a mix.
1. Turn off the heat and transfer the Dondakkai / Kovakkai Poriyal into a serving bowlServe the Kovakkai Poriyal along with Jeera Rasam, Mixed Vegetable Sambar, Beetroot Pachadi, Steamed Rice and Elai Vadam for a delicious weekend South Indian meal.
