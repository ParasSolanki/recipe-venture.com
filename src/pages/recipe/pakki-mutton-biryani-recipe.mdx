### Instructions

1. To begin with the Pakki Mutton Biryani, wash goat pieces well with water, drain and keep it aside.
1. Heat a little oil on a skillet and fry sliced onions and caramelize until they turn brownish black in colour.
1. These will be used to garnish the biryani.
1. Add oil in a pressure cooker and fry garam masala along with onions, ginger garlic paste and little salt.
1. When onion changes colour, add goat pieces.
1. Add biryani masala, green chilies, handful of coriander leaves, red chilli powder, lime juice, yogurt and cover it with a lid.
1. Pressure cook for upto 5-6 and then switch off the pressure cooker.
1. In the mean time, in a separate vessel, add 2-3 cups of water and after water boils, add little salt, jeera and soaked rice.
1. Cook until rice is 90% cooked.
1. This will take roughly around 10 minutes.
1. Remove and strain the rice.
1. Now lets make layers in a baking pan.
1. First add half of the rice at the bottom of the baking pan and sprinkle ghee, chopped coriander, saffron milk and then arrange few cooked goat pieces (don't add the gravy you get after goat is cooked.
1. Reserve it for the end part) on top of this rice.
1. Again add remaining rice on top of the pieces and sprinkle ghee, chopped coriander, saffron milk and the gravy of the goat meat which you had reserved.
1. Cover this pan tight with aluminium foil and bake at preheated oven at 350 degree Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes.
1. Remove and it is ready to be served.
1. Serve Pakki Mutton Biryani with Burani raita or any other raita of your choice for a laid out Sunday meal with your family.
