### Instructions

1. To begin making the Stuffed Masala Aloo Naan Recipe Made Without Oven, first prep all the ingredients and keep them ready by the side.
1. Mix the flour, salt & ghee and knead a dough with soda water until you get a smooth dough.
1. Set aside the naan dough for 30 minutes.
1. Meanwhile mix the ingredients for the stuffed masala naan.
1. Combine all the ingredients for the masala naan stuffing in a large mixing bowl.
1. Check the taste and adjust to suit the palate.
1. Set this aside.
1. After the naan dough has rested take small portion of it, dust in flour and roll them into a small circle.
1. Place a large spoonful of the stuffing in the center and seal the dough.
1. Flatten it and roll the stuffed masala naan just a bit to make an oval or round shape.
1. The next step is to cook the naan.
1. You can either bake it in the oven or cook in a skillet/ tawa.
1. Take heavy bottomed skillet/ tawa and cook the naans on one side.
1. Once you notice one side is getting cooked, place the other uncooked side of the stuffed naan on flame.
1. Grill the Stuffed Masala Naan till it is cooked and charred a bit.
1. Once the masala naan is cooked, remove from the heat.
1. Smear some butter on the naan and serve hot.
