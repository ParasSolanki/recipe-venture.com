### Instructions

1. To begin making the Millet and Jowar Paniyaram Recipe, soak the grains in water for atleast 8 hours.
1. Grind it into a smooth paste by adding little water.
1. The batter should not be too thin as well.
1. Add a teaspoon of soda and salt and keep it aside.
1. Heat a flat skillet with oil, add mustard seeds and urad dal and allow it splutter for few seconds.
1. Add chopped curry leaves and leave it to crackle, add ginger, garlic and saute until it softens.
1. Once that is done, add onions and saute till they turn translucent.
1. Switch off the heat and add coriander leaves and coconut and give it a stir.
1. Add the sauted onion mixture into the batter and mix well and check salt and keep kuzhi paniyaram pan ready to start cooking.
1. Heat Paniyaram pan on low-medium heat.
1. Pour 1 teaspoon ghee into each cavity of the pan.

1. Cover the pan with a lid and cook on low to medium heat for about 3 to 4 minutes until the top of the paniyaram is steamed.
