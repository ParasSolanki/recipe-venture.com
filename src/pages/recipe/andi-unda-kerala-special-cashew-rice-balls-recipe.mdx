### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Red matta rice.
- 1 cup Jaggery - powdered or brown sugar.
- 1 cup Cashew nuts - unsalted.
- 1 cup Dry coconut (kopra).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Andi Unda recipe, roast the red matta rice in a wide pan without oil.
1. The rice will become crispy and starts crackling.
1. Once you start hearing the sound of crackle, take it off the stove and let it cool on a flat plate.
1. In the same wide pan, add the cashew-nuts and dry roast them until they turn brown.
1. Take care not to burn or black them.
1. Once roasted, spread them on a flat plate to cool down.
1. In a mixer grinder, first, grind the rice to a fine powder.
1. Next grind the cashew-nuts.
1. Do not run the mixer continuously, it will result in cashew butter, we don't need cashew paste, we need powdered cashews, so just pulse it 4-5 times.
1. Mix powdered cashews, powdered rice, powdered jaggery and coconut together.
1. Transfer the mixture to a mixer grinder and pulse them together 4-5 times to mix it well.
1. This will help to bind them easily into balls.
1. Transfer the contents to a clean bowl, take fist pull of powder and start making balls by pressing it tightly in your palms, shaping them like laddus.
1. Keep the balls in a clean flat plate.
1. Follow the same process with the remaining mixture.
1. Andi Unda tastes best within 2-3 days.
1. If you are planning to store for more days, then keep them in an air-tight container in the refrigerator.
1. But then too, it is best to consume them within a week or 10 days.
1. Serve them as a snack during hunger-pangs or even as a regular addition to your kids lunch box to improve their nutrient intake.
