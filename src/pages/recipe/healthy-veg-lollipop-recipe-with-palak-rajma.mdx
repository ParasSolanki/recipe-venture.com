1. Drain the water and pressure cook the soaked rajma with fresh water upto 8 to 10 whistles/ about 30 minutes so that they are soft when pressed.
1. Let the pressure release on its own.
1. Drain the water from the rajma and use it for any other purpose (in a curry or to knead chapati dough).

1. In the meantime, thoroughly wash palak leaves multiple times.
1. Saute the spinach lighty in a pan without any oil until soft and the spinach shrinks.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the spinach to cool.
1. Now, finely powder rolled oats in a mixer/blender and set aside.
1. In a mixing bowl, take cooked rajma and mash it well using a masher or with your hand.
1. Do not make it completely smooth, but coarsely mash some of them.
1. This will give you a nice texture when you bite the lollipops.
1. Next, add the cooked spinach, oats powder, salt and all the spices mentioned under 'To make Palak Rajma Oats Lollipop' which includes red chilli powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder, amchur powder, salt and oil.

1. If your dough is sticky, you can add more oats powder.
1. Make small lemon sized balls and set aside.
1. Check the spices and salt and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Now, you will have to make a thin paste of gram flour.
1. For this, mix gram flour with salt and turmeric powder.
1. Add water as required and whisk well to form a lump-free, thin paste.
1. Set aside.
1. Next, make a coarse powder of rolled oats and set aside.
1. Coating the veg lollipops with oats gives a nice crunchy texture to them.
1. Now, heat a paddu / appe / paniyaram pan and add few drops of oil to each of the cavities.
1. Dip each of the veg lollipop balls in gram flour mixture and roll them gently over oats so that they are uniformly coated.
1. Gently place the veg lollipop balls inside the oiled cavities of the paddu pan.
1. Cook them in low-medium heat until light brown in colour.
1. Flip the veg lollipops around so that they cook well on all sides.
1. Once the veg lollipops they are done, transfer them onto a paper towel to remove excess oil.
1. Gently prick each of them with a toothpick so that they resemble a lollipop.
