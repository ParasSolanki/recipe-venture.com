### Ingredients

- 1 Green Chilli - finely chopped.
- Sunflower Oil.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/2 cup Gram flour (besan).
- 1/2 cup Jowar Flour (Sorghum).
- 2 tablespoons Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- 1/2 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/2 cup Methi Leaves (Fenugreek Leaves) - chopped.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 1 inch Ginger - finely chopped.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Methi Thalipeeth, in a large bowl combine all the ingredients except the yogurt and oil.
1.  Once the dry ingredients are combined, stir in the yogurt and knead well to make a firm dough, adding water if necessary.
1. Knead for a couple of minutes until smooth.
1.  Cover the dough and allow it to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
1. Divide the dough into 15, 2-inch diameter balls.
1. Using the palm of your hands flatten each ball, dust the surface of the ball on whole wheat flour and roll into a 4 to 6 inch diameter circle.
1. You can roll them thick or thin, it is purely your preference.
1. Preheat an iron skillet on high heat; place the rolled dough on the skillet; after about a few seconds you will notice that smalls bubbles start rising on the dough.
1. Turn the heat to medium; flip the rolled dough over and drizzle about half teaspoon of oil around the dough.
1. Cook with a press and turn motion with a flat spatula or a wooden press.
1.  You will notice the bottom side begins to brown, at this point flip over again cooking in the same press and turn motion to maintain even cooking.
1. Once both the sides are cooked and have a few brown spots, you will also notice the texture of the bread is crisp on the outside and soft inside.
1. Continue the similar process with the other portions of the dough and serve warm.
1. Serve the  Methi Thalipeeth Recipe (Fresh Fenugreek Leaves Flat Bread) along with Maharashtrian Green Chilli Thecha Recipe or Lahsun ki Chutney along with Gulkand Chai Recipe by the side.
