### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mustard Vegetable Curry Recipe, we will first have to steam the vegetables and keep them ready You can use a steamer or a pressure cooker to cook the vegetables.
1. Potatoes take a longer time to cook, so I suggest you cook them separate from the beans, carrots and peas.
1. To begin making the curry base; heat a teaspoon of oil in a pan on medium heat.
1. Add in the cumin seeds, garlic and onion and saute on medium heat until the onion has turned light pink and translucent.
1. Once the onions are ready; add in the turmeric powder, chilli powder and stir for a few seconds.
1. Finally add in the coconut milk, the vegetable stock and the dijon mustard.
1. Add in the salt and check the spice and salt levels.
1. Adjust to suit your taste.
1. Finally stir in the steamed vegetables; turn the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer the curry 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Turn off the heat and the Mustard Vegetable Curry is ready to be served.
1. Serve the Mustard Vegetable Curry hot with steamed rice or tawa paratha for dinner.
