- 1/4 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 tablespoon Cumin powder (Jeera).
- 1/4 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Bajri Methi Na Vada Recipe, combine both the bajra flour and the whole wheat flour along with the finely chopped fenugreek leaves, red chili powder, coriander powder, salt, green chilli and yogurt in a mixing bowl.
1. Bring all the ingredients together by rubbing them between your fingers.
1. This will make them combine and it will begin to get lumpy.
1. Add a little water at a time to bring it together, and knead it into a stiff dough.
1. At this stage, be careful not to add too much water at one go, or the dough will have excess moisture.
1. Set the dough aside in the same mixing bowl and cover it.
1. Let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
1. In a small bowl combine the cumin seeds, sesame seeds and carom (ajwain) seeds.
1. Set aside till required.
1. Preheat oil in a kadhai over a medium heat.
1. While the oil is getting warmed up, divide the prepared dough into small marble sized portions.
1. Take each ball and roll it between your palms to make a smooth ball.
1. Then flatten each ball out with your fingers, into a small disc.
1. Ensure that the edges along the circumference are not cracked.
1. Sprinkle a pinch of the seeds mixture over the vada and press them gently with your fingers, to embed them into the vada.
1. Continue this till all the vadas are prepared, lining them up as you go, in preparation to deep fry them.
1. When the oil is hot enough, add the vadas one by one into the hot oil.
1. Fry them in small batches, taking care not to overcrowd the kathai.
1. Deep fry till golden and crisp on both the sides.
1. Then, using a slotted spoon, drain the excess oil and transfer them to a plate lined with an kitchen paper to absorb the excess oil.
1. Serve the Bajri Methi Na Vada along with Pudina Chutney and a steaming cup of Masala Chai to bring an extra crunch to your chai time or chai party.
