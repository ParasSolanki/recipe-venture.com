### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mixed Vegetable Pulao Recipe, we will first wash and soak rice in 2 cups of water for half an hour.
1. While the rice is soaking, steam the vegetables with a bit of salt and keep aside.
1. Make a powder of all the spices (cloves, cardamom and cinnamon) using a pestle and mortar.
1. Keep aside.
1. After half an hour, into a large saucepan heat 2 tablespoons of ghee.
1. Add the grated garlic and the powdered spices.
1. Stir-fry for a few seconds.
1. Next add in the rice, salt , green chillies and the bay leaves along with the water it was soaked in.
1. Turn the heat to high and allow the rice mixture to come to a boil.
1. Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer the rice until the rice absorbs all the water.
1. Once the water is absorbed, check if the pulao is cooked completely, to suit your taste.
1. If it needs to be softer, you can add in a little more water and cook for a bit more time.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the pulao to rest for at least 10 minutes, this will help the rice to become a little stiff and remain as grains.
1. Finally stir in the steamed vegetables and chopped mint leaves and check the salt and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Transfer the Vegetable Pulao to a serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve Mixed Vegetable Pulao along with Boondi Raita, Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita or any other raita of your choice and a roasted papad for everyday meals.
