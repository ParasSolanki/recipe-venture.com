### Instructions

1. To begin making the Roasted Eggplant Rolls Recipe we will first have to roast the eggplants.
1. I personally like to roast it on the pan, but you can roast them in the oven too.
1. First, slice the eggplant lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices, sprinkle some salt and drizzle some olive oil over the eggplants and toss them well until well coated.
1. Roasting Eggplants in the Oven - Preheat oven to 180 CArrange the eggplants on a baking tray and loosely cover the tray with foil and roast the eggplants in the preheated oven roast until they are soft and pliable, about 15 to 20 minutes, turning them half way through while it is roasting.
1. Roasting Eggplants on a SkilletPreheat a skillet on medium heat; place the eggplant slices on the skillet and roast them until soft and cooked on both sides.
1. Proceed the same way to roast the remaining eggplants.
1. Now, we will use only the eggplant that have the largest rounds, as we will be able to stuff and roll only the larger rounds.
1. The smaller rounds you can chop them fine and use them as you wish.
1. For the StuffingHeat a tablespoon of oil in wok and stir fry the carrots for a couple of minutes until al dente (not too soft - not too firm).
1. Turn off the heat; sprinkle some salt and chopped parsley leaves and stir well.
1. Place the grilled eggplants on a flat surface, arrange the roasted carrots, a teaspoon of pesto at end of each grilled eggplant slice.
1. Roll the eggplant slices around to enclose the filling and arrange on the platter with the seam side down.
1. When you are ready to serve, sprinkle more cheese on top of the eggplants that you have arrange in a baking dish and broil in the oven until the cheese melts.
1. Serve the Grilled Eggplant Roll with Spicy Herbed Carrots with Tzatziki - Greek Yogurt Dip and a good red wine for parties.
1. Serve the Grilled Eggplant Roll with Spicy Herbed Carrots as a healthy appetizer for your parties, may be along with Sichuan Style Chilli Potato Recipe or Stir Fried Honey Parsnip Recipe With Herbs.
