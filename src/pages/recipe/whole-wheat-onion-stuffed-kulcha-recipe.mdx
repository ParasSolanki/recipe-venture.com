### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Wheat Onion Kulcha recipe, we will first prepare the dough and set it for rising.
1. To prepare the dough for Kulcha, sift flour with salt in a large bowl.
1. Add yeast, salt, sugar, garlic powder or chopped garlic and stir to combine all the ingredients.
1. Add the lukewarm water little at a time and knead to make a soft and smooth dough.
1. Knead well for about 5 minutes so the dough becomes light and fluffy.
1. Cover the dough and set it to rise in a warm place for a couple of hours or until it is doubled.
1. Once the dough has risen or close to its ready time, we will prepare the stuffing for the Kulchas.
1. Into a food processor add onion, mint, coriander, garlic and process to fine chop.
1. If you are not using any food processor then make sure to fine chop all the four ingredients.
1. Once the dough gets doubled in size bring it out and ounch it with your fingers to release the trapped air.
1. To make kulchas, heat iron skillet over medium heat, pinch out a small portion from the dough and shape it into a round.
1. Roll out the ball into a circle of approx 2 inch diameter.
1. Spoon a tablespoon of filling into the center.
1. Bring the corners of the dough to the centre to seal the Kulcha dough.
1. Once again gently flatten the ball with light pressure of your palm.
1. Dust lightly on flour and roll it out into a circle without putting too much pressure on the kulcha else filling will ooze out from the sides.
1. Transfer the rolled out Kulcha dough to the hot skillet.
1. Cook on both the sides until you see it starts puffing up.
1. Once it does, transfer it to direct heat to puff up the Kulchas.
1.  While cooking over the direct heat make sure to flip the kulcha continuously to cook evenly from all sides.
