### Instructions

1. To begin making Banana Stem Sabzi Recipe With Curry Powder, prep all the ingredients first.
1. Then make cuts on the layer of banana stem and then discard the outer covering.
1. Slice the banana stem and as you do, you will find the fibre coming out every time you slice into stem, keep taking them out while proceeding.
1. Once sliced, take each slice and chop them to about 1 cm pieces.
1. Take a kadai and heat cooking oil in it.
1. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and allow them to splutter.
1. Once they do splutter, add in the cumin seeds and allow to sizzle.
1. Add curry leaves immediately and saute for a bit on medium heat till the curry leaves crisp up a bit.
1. Add the chopped onions, and keep sauteing on medium heat until they turn translucent.
1. Add in the chopped banana stem pieces and cook with a bit of water.
1. Cook covered till the banana stem is softened and cooked.
1. You can opt to undercook the banana stem as well, depending on your preference.
1. The sabzi will be crunchier if the stem is undercooked.
1. Once done, add the spices, cumin powder, curry powder or sambar powder, red chilli powder, besan (adding besan is optional.
1. I used it to soak the extra water added), salt and give a nice stir till combined.
1. Keep on medium heat for 1-2 minutes, check for seasoning and adjust.
1. Switch off heat.
1. Serve Banana Stem Sabzi Recipe With Curry Powder along with Lobia Masala Recipe (Black Eyed Bean Curry), Phulka and Indian Vegetable Salad Recipe for lunch or dinner.
