1. To begin making the Roasted Vegetable Au Gratin Recipe into a preheated pan add oil, zucchini, carrots and green beans.

1. Saute and power cook the vegetables on high heat for a minute or two.

1. Next we will make the cheese sauce; melt butter over low heat in a heavy-bottomed saucepan and add flour.
1. Turn the heat down and keep stirring so as to avoid any lumps.
1. When the flour smells toasted and turns light brown in color and mixes together evenly with the butter, pour in the milk and cheese spread and keep stirring to avoid any lumps.
1. Once you get a smooth mixture turn off the heat and keep aside.
1. For assembling the Roasted Vegetable Au Gratin Recipe into a baking dish pour the white sauce and add the cooked vegetables.
1. Mix well and spread the mixture evenly in the baking dish.
1. Finally spread the grated cheese evenly on the top.
1. Place the Roasted Vegetable Au Gratin Recipe in the preheated oven at 180 degree Celcius.
1. Bake until the cheese melts and is lightly golden brown in colour.
1. Once done remove the Roasted Vegetable Au Gratin Recipe from the oven and serve hot.
