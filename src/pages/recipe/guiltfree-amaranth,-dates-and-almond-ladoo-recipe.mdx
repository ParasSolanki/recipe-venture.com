### Ingredients

- 1 pinch Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 10 Badam (Almond) - powdered.
- 1/2 cup Dates - deseeded and finely chopped.
- 8 Badam (Almond) - coarsely chopped.
- 1/2 cup Amaranth Seeds (Rajgira).
- 1 teaspoon Coconut Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Guilt-free Amaranth, Dates and Almond Ladoo, add 1/2 cup amaranth to 1-1/2 cups of water in a saucepan and place it on a medium heat.
1. Bring the mixture to a boil and allow it simmer for 7-10 minutes.
1. When the amaranth has absorbed a little bit of water and looks slightly cooked, add the finely chopped dates to it and continue to cook, covered, for another 5 minutes.
1. At this stage, you can add more water if required.
1. When the amaranth is fully cooked it should be soft to touch.
1. At this stage, add cardamom powder and oil and cook it further on a medium heat until everything comes together and most of the water has dried up.
1. Add the chopped and powdered almonds; mix well and turn off the heat.
1. Set the saucepan aside and allow the mixture cool down completely.
1. Now, to make the energy balls, grease your palms with a little bit of oil, pinch off small bits of the sweet amaranth mixture, roll it between your palms to make little balls.
1. Itâ€™ll be very soft and sticky so take care while handling it.
1. Decorate them with small pieces of almonds and lay them out in a platter or store in an airtight box.
1. You can serve the Amaranth, Dates and Almond Ladoo right away or let them chill in the refrigerator for a couple of hours for all the flavors to develop well.
