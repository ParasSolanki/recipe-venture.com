### Ingredients

- Carrot Cake - 1 recipe or leftover.
- 1/3 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- 130 grams Britannia Cream Cheese - at room temperature.
- 1 tablespoon Sugar - powdered.
- 1 cup Icing Sugar - (220 ml).
- 30 grams Butter - cold and cubed.
- 1/4 cup Walnuts - chopped.
- 1/2 cup Instant Oats (Oatmeal).
- 50 grams Butter (unsalted) - at room temperature.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Leftover Carrot Cake Mini Trifle, in a bowl, add the carrot cake and crumble it using a fork.
1. Once done, keep it aside.
1. To make the oats-walnut crumble, first put your oven on preheat at 180°C.
1. Next in a bowl, add all purpose flour, oats, powdered sugar, chopped walnuts and give it a good mix.
1. Next, add 30 grams cubed & cold butter to the oats mixture and rub the mixture with your hands until it resembles bread crumbs.
1. Now spread the mixture in a baking pan and bake at 180°C for 15 minutes or until the crumble becomes golden brown in colour.
1. Once it’s done, keep it aside to cool down.
1. While the crumble is baking in the oven, you can prepare your cream cheese frosting.
1. To make that, add cream cheese, butter, and vanilla essence to a bowl and beat at medium speed until mixture becomes creamy.
1. Now start adding icing sugar, 1/3rd at a time, and beat at medium speed till sugar is well incorporated.
1. Your cream cheese frosting is ready.
1. Put your frosting in a piping bag and keep aside.
1. This recipe makes 6 glasses of trifle (each measuring 250ml and 3 inches long).
1. Now to assemble the trifle, first, divide your carrot cake crumbs into 12 equal parts as you need 12 layers of carrot cake (2 in each trifle glass).
1. Similarly divide your oats-walnut crumble also into 12 equal parts.
1. Next, add a layer of carrot cake crumbs at the bottom of each glass.
1. It should be about half inch thick.
1. Now on top of this first layer, add the layer of your cream cheese frosting.
1. Next, add the third layer of the cooled oats-walnut crumble.
1. Repeat the layers in the same order once more and that will become your 4th, 5th, and 6th layer.
1. Your mini trifle glasses are ready.
1. Keep them in refrigerator for about 2 hours before serving.
1. Serve these delectable Leftover Carrot Cake Mini Trifles as a dessert at your Tea parties along with a cup of Masala Chai or after a delicious meal of Pasta Aglio Olio and Savory Melon Salad.
