### Instructions

1. To begin preparing the Spicy Sweet Corn & Oat Fritters Recipe, get all the ingredients under the section “To grind”.
1. Add it to a mixer and grind to make a coarse mixture of the corn, green chillies, ginger and cumin seeds.
1. Transfer the ground mixture into a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the remaining ingredients into the bowl along with ground sweet corn mixture.
1. Combine all of it well and get a thick consistency to make the vada.
1.  Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Note: add the powdered oats little by little, until you get the required consistency.
1. The mixture should be fairly thick so that it holds well when fritters are formed.
1. At this stage the consistency is critical.
1. If not thick enough, the fritters will absorb too much oil while deep-frying.
1. If you feel the mixture is not thick enough, you can add a tablespoon of rice flour or chickpea flour (besan) to bind it.
1. Method to Deep fry The Sweet Corn VadasTo form the fritters or vadas, take a tablespoon of the mixture at a time, about the size of a small lemon.
1. Flatten it on wet palm to make a patty or fritter and place it on a platter or plate.
1. Repeat, until all the mixture is used.
1. You can refrigerate the vadas for 15 minutes.
1. This allows them to dry out and firm up a little before deep-frying.
1. This is an optional step, and if your mixture is firm enough the vadas may be fried directly without refrigeration.
1. Heat oil for deep frying, in a kadhai, over a high heat.
1. When hot enough, reduce the heat and slowly slide the patties into the oil.
1. Fry them on both sides till they are a golden.
1. Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon, drain the Sweet Corn Vadas on paper towels to remove the excess oil and serve the sweet corn vadas hot.
1. Method to Bake the Sweet Corn VadasTo bake the fritters, first preheat the oven at 200 degrees celsius for 15-20 minutes.
1. Spread a baking sheet or parchment paper on the baking tray.
1. Lightly grease your palms with oil so as to handle the mixture more easily and shape the fritters.
1. Take a tablespoon of mixture at a time, about the size of a small lemon.
1. Flatten it on your palm to make a patty or fritter and place it on the baking sheet.
1. Repeat, until all the mixture is used, and lay the fritters in rows about an inch apart.
1. Brush the fritters a little oil.
1. Slide the baking tray into the oven and bake at 200 degrees celsius for 15 to 18 minutes turning the fritters over half way through so they brown evenly on both the sides.
1. For a crisp topping, now turn the oven mode to broil and let them bake for another minute or two until crisp.
1. Once done remove the Sweet Corn & Oats Masala Vadas from the oven and serve hot.
1. Serve the Sweet Corn & Oats Masala Vadas hot with Masala Chai for a great monsoon tea time treat.
