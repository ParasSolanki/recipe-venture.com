### Ingredients

- 2 cup Fresh cream.
- 1 tablespoon Gelatin.
- Orange Zest (Rind) - of one orange.
- 1 cup Milk.
- 4 Oranges.
- 1/2 cup Sugar.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Burnt Orange Panna Cotta Recipe, first prepare the oven-roasted orange chips.
1. Slice the orange into 5mm thick slices.
1. Lay them out in a baking sheet, sprinkle some sugar over it and place the sheet in a preheated oven to bake at a 100 degrees centigrade for 2 hours, or till they get crisp.
1. To prepare the pacanotta, squeeze the juice of the remaining one orange.
1. Put it in a saucepan, over a high heat and bring it to a boil.
1. Keeping the heat high, allow the juice to slowly start caramelising.
1. This is the point at which it will slowly begin to smell burnt.
1. Continue this on a medium heat, until the juice is reduced to half its original quantity.
1. Then, turn the heat off and set the caramelised orange juice to cool down completely.
1. When it is cool, pour in the milk followed by the cream.
1. Place the saucepan on a medium heat again and gently heat it, without allowing it to boil.
1. Meanwhile, melt the gelatin in water by sprinkling it over it 1/4 cup of room temperature water.
1. Set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom.
1. Add the sugar and grated orange zest to this and stir till the sugar gently till the sugar has dissolved.
1. Take care not to allow the panna cotta mix to burn.
1. At this stage, add the bloomed gelatine to the panna cotta mix.
1. Continue stirring and let the gelatin completely dissolve as well.
1. Pour the panna cotta mix through a sieve, into a jug or bowl to remove any leftover particles of gelatin and the orange peel.
1. You will be left with a smooth panna cotta mix.
1. Pour this mixture into individual serving glasses.
1. Place the glasses on your counter top for 15 minutes, to settle, before transferring them to the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
1. To serve, slit the orange chips and use them to garnish the edges of the Panna Cotta glasses.
