### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kathal Masala Sabzi Recipe, let us first cut the raw jackfruit.
1. In order to do that we have to first grease our hands and the knife that is going to be used with oil.
1. This important tip ensures that the hands don't get sticky from the natural fruit latex/sap present in the fruit and makes the cutting process hassle-free.

1. In a small pressure cooker, add 1 tablespoon of oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add hing/asafoetida to it.
1. Next add finely chopped onions garlic, ginger and saute until the onions brown up.
1. Once done add in cinnamon stick and black cardamom and stir the spices well into the onions.
1. Now add the prepared curd masala in the cooker.
1. Add the tomato puree, the kathal/raw jackfruit and aloo/potato to the masala, add salt as per taste and stir well to combine.
1. Add 1 cup of water, cover the pressure cooker and cook the Kathal Masala Sabzi for 3 to 4 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure has released, turn off the heat.
1. Open the cooker, add in the chopped coriander leaves and mix, check the salt and spices and adjust accordingly.
1. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve Kathal Masala Sabzi Recipe along with Phulkas or even Jeera Rice along with a Carrot Salad and a bowl of curd for a complete and simple Sunday lunch.
