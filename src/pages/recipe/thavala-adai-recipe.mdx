- 1/4 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 1 cup Rice - soaked for atleast 4 hours.
- 1/4 cup Arhar dal (Split Toor Dal) - soaked for atleast 2 hours.
- 2 teaspoons Gingelly oil.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 6 Curry leaves.
- 1 teaspoon White Urad Dal (Split) - soaked for atleast 2 hours.

### Instructions

1. To begin with Thavala Adai Recipe, soak the raw rice separately and all the dals together with the red chillies.
1. Once the ingredients are nicely soaked, first grind the dal into a fine paste like adai batter.
1. Drain the water from the rice and grind it coarsely.
1. Add 2 teaspoons gangly oil in a kadhai.
1. Once the oil heats, add the mustard seeds.
1. When the mustard seeds starts to crackle, add hing.
1. Once it is done, add 3 cups of water into the kadhai and let it boil.
1. When it starts boiling, add the curry leaves and salt.
1. After this, add the broken rice and let it cook for about 10 minutes.
1. When the rice is cooked, add the ground dal paste in the cooked rice and mix it well to avoid any lumps in the kadhai.
1. When it comes to a thick mixture, switch off the heat and let it cool for about 20-25 minutes.
1. Now pour oil on an iron dosa tawa.
1. Once the oil is heated, take a small ball of lemon size from the mixture and make it flat with hands like cutlet.
1. Place it on the tawa and roast on both the sides well till it becomes nice golden brown in colour.
1. Follow the same process for the remaining mixture.
1. Serve Thavala Adai with South Indian Coconut Chutney, Dhaniya Pudina Chutney or any chutney of your choice.
