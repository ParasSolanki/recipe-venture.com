1. Take care not to cut the parwal completely into two pieces, it should remain whole.
1. Take out the seeds carefully from the parwals.
1. Heat some water in a saucepan and when the water starts to boil, put parwals in it.
1. Let them boil for about 3-4 minutes and then turn off the heat.
1. Cover the pan with a lid and set it aside for half an hour.
1. After half an hour, strain the water entirely from the parwals.
1. In an another saucepan, add water and sugar and let it boil until it forms a syrup.
1. Stir in continuously so that the sugar gets dissolved in the water properly.
1. Put all the parwals in this syrup and let it boil till it changes its colour.
1. Flip the side of the parwal while boiling it.
1. Turn off the flame, cover the vessel and leave it for 1 hour in the syrup.
1. Let them get sweet.
1. The next step is to prepare the filling.
1. Put khoya in a wide pan and roast it on a medium flame till it turns light pink in colour.
1. Let it cool down.
1. Once done, grind almonds in the grinder and cut pistachios in long pieces.
1. Add ground almonds, cardamom and sugar into the roasted khoya.
1. The filling to stuff the parwal is ready.
1. Take out the parwal from the syrup and place them on a plate.
1. Tilt the plate so that any excess syrup drip off from the parwal.
1. Now stuff each parwal with the filling and press the filling with light hands so it settles down inside the parwal.
1. Put pistachios to decorate.
1. Follow the same process for the remaining parwals and your Parwal Ki Mithai is ready to be served.
