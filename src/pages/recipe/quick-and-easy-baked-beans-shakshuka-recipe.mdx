### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Sugar - (optional).
- 3 cloves Garlic - finely chopped or minced.
- 3 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- 1 Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - small bunch.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera).
- 1 Baked beans - tin or homemade.
- 2 Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- 1 tablespoon Butter.
- 1/4 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- 1/4 teaspoon Cayenne Pepper - freshly ground/powdered.
- 1 Green Bell Pepper (Capsicum) - finely chopped.
- 4 Whole Eggs.
- 1 Onion - thinly sliced.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Baked Beans Shakshuka, first set a thick-bottomed pan or skillet on a low flame.
1. Allow it to gently heat and drop the butter and olive oil into it.
1. The oil prevents the butter from burning, when it heats up.
1. When the butter has melted slightly, add in the sliced onion, green chillies and garlic to the pan.
1. Toss gently for 2-3 minutes until aromatic, and the onion has turned a soft, pale colour.
1. Next, add in the baked beans from the can and mix well.
1. Simmer for 4-5 minutes till the mixture begins to bubble gently.
1. Then, add the cumin, pepper, garam masala and mix well.
1. Add salt to taste, bearing in mind that the canned beans may already contain a little salt.
1. Adding a teaspoon of sugar helps cut the excessive tanginess of the tinned beans.
1. If using sugar, add now.
1. Gently break the four eggs directly on to the beans and do not mix at all.
1. Lower the flame, cover and allow the entire mixture to slowly cook until the eggs are cooked through.
1. When the eggs are no longer translucent, turn off the flame and garnish with freshly chopped coriander.
1. Serve Baked Beans Shakshuka along with toasted Eggless Herbed Focaccia Bread and Charred Corn and Radish Salad.
