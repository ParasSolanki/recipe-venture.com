### Instructions

1. To begin making the Spinach And Soya Sub Sandwich Recipe, first preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celsius.
1. Line a baking sheet with foil and grease it with some oil and set aside till later use.
1. Drain the excess water from the soy chunks and add the chunks and the spinach to a food processor.
1. Pulse couple of times or until they are crumbled.
1. Set this aside for later use too.
1. In a mixing bowl add garlic, butter, parmesan cheese, feta cheese, bread crumbs, oregano with required salt and pepper.
1. Mix well using your hands and crumble the cheese.
1. Add spinach and soya chunks mixture and combine so everything is mixed well.
1. Add the beaten egg and mix with a fork to combine.
1. Roll the spinach soy mixture into about 20 small balls and arrange on the baking sheet.
1. Place the sheet into the oven to bake the soya-balls for about 20 minutes, until fully cooked.
1. Remove from the oven and keep them aside.
1. You can also alternatively use a Kuzhi Paniyaram pan and cook the spinach and soy balls in the pan until cooked through and browned.
1. You will have to add a little oil in the cavities of the pan and cook the soy meatballs.
1. Next, slice the French bread rolls down the centre and open them, butter them and place them on the baking sheet.
1. Arrange 3 spinach balls on each roll half.
1. Top the sub sandwiches with the tomato sauce and 2 slices of mozzarella per sandwich.
1. Place the other top cover of the bread, alongside with the other bread that has topping, so it gets grilled along with the other bread.
1. Place the sheet into the oven and bake at 180 C for about 10 minutes until the cheese melts and the bread looks grilled and crisp.
1. Remove from oven and close the sandwich with the top cover of the bread.
1. Serve Spinach And Soya Sub Sandwich along with Zucchini Salad With Thai Hot Chili Dressing for a weeknight dinner.
