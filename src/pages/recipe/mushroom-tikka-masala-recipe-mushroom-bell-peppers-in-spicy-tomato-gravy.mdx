### Instructions

1. To begin making Mushroom Tikka Masala Recipe (Mushroom & Bell Peppers In Spicy Tomato Gravy), prep up with all the ingredients and start with marinating the mushrooms.
1. In a large mixing bowl, add all the marinade ingredients, except mushrooms.
1. Mix well, do a taste test and adjust spices and salt according to your taste.
1. Add in the cut mushrooms and toss well to coat the mushrooms with the marinade evenly.
1. Cover with a cling wrap or plate and keep in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour.
1. Preparing Tikka Masala Paste:In a kadai, heat 2 tablespoons oil and once hot, add the cloves, cumin, cinnamon and green cardamom.
1. Sauté for a few seconds.
1. Add the chopped onions, green chillies, ginger, garlic and cashew nuts; fry for a few minutes till lightly roasted and the onions turn soft and cashews light brown.
1. Stir in the chopped tomatoes along with a pinch of salt and fry on medium flame until the tomatoes are slightly cooked, turn soft and most of the moisture is gone (you can see the gravy leaving the sides of the pan); about 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Remove from flame and let cool.
1. Once cooled a bit, place the fried mixture in a blender jar and blend to a fine paste; there is no need to add any water as the moisture in the tomatoes is enough to make a smooth creamy paste.
1. Keep aside.
1. Preparing the Mushroom Tikka MasalaNow, heat the same saucepan with about 2 teaspoons of oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add the marinated mushroom (if there is marinade left in the bowl, do not add this; you can add this in the tikka masala gravy later) and fry on medium high heat, stirring continuously.
1. When the mushrooms starts to wilt, it will start to release water.
1. Keep stirring.
1. Once most of the moisture is gone, add the cubed capsicum and sauté again for a few minutes till the mixture is well roasted.

1. Sauté for a few seconds; tip in the rest of the spices; coriander powder, garam masala powder, turmeric powder and salt to taste (remember, the grilled mushrooms have salt too, so add accordingly); give it a good stir.
1. Add about 1 cup of water (rinse the blender jar and add this water too), mix well and bring to a boil on medium high heat.
1. Adjust the consistency of the gravy according to how thin or thick you want it.
1. At this stage, if you have any leftover marinade, you can add that too.
1. Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat and stir in the sautéed mushrooms and bell pepper mixture.
1. Mix well, adjust the salt and heat on medium high, until the mixture is heated through; about 2 to 3 minutes.
