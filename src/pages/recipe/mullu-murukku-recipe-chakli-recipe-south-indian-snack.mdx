- 1/4 cup Water.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mullu Murukku Recipe, keep all the ingredients ready.
1. In a small jar of the mixer grinder, blend the cream, ginger and green chillies and make a smooth paste.
1. Into a large mixing now, combine all the rice flour, the ground cream, green chilli, ginger paste, salt, hing and sesame seeds.
1. Add little water at a time and knead to make a soft dough.
1. Grease the Sev Press or the Sev Sancha with oil and place the plate which has one star into the press.
1. Heat oil in a deep frying pan on medium high heat.

1. Prepare about 5 square pieces of aluminum foil each of size 2 inch.
1. Grease them with oil and arrange them in two lines on your work surface.
1. Slowly start to press the Murukku dough into a spiral shape starting from the centre going outwards on the square strip of the aluminium foil.
1. (About 2.
1. 5 spirals).
1. Gently lift the foil and slide the spiral Murukku into the hot oil from the side of the frying pan, so the oil does not splash on to you.
1. Add about 3 or 4 more Murukku spirals into the frying pan.
1. Care not to overcrowd the pan, allowing all of them to stay afloat together and not a few sunken in between the others.
1. Turn over once after a few seconds and fry until the Murukku is golden.
1. Drain the oil completely with a slotted spoon and allow the Murukku to cool completely.
1. Press the remaining batches of the Murukku dough in the similar manner and deep fry on medium heat.
1. Cool the murukkus and store in airtight containers.
