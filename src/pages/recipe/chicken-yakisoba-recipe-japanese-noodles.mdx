### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chicken Yakisoba Recipe, we will first boil the yakisoba noodles.
1. Note: If you are unable to find yakisoba noodles, you can use the noodles, from the maggi noodles pack without the maggi masala.
1. To cook the Yakisoba Noodles Heat a saucepan with water and bring it to a boil.
1. To the water, add a teaspoon of oil and salt.
1. Once the water comes to a rolling boil, reduce the flame and add the noodles.
1. Cook for about 4-6 minutes on medium flame, we want the noodles to be just about cooked.
1. Make sure it is not over cooked.
1. Turn off the flame, and transfer the noodles into a sieve, draining off all the water.
1. Run cold water over the yakisoba noodles to cut the cooking process.
1. Drizzle a little oil over the noodles and ruffle the noodles, ensuring they do not stick to each other.
1. Keep it aside.
