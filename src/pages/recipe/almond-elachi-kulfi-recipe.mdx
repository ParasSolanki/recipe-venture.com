### Ingredients

- 1 cup Badam (Almond) - soaked.
- 1/2 cup Pistachios - chopped.
- 1 cup Sugar.
- 1/4 Saffron strands.
- 2 liter Milk - full fat+ 1 cup.
- 1 tablespoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Badam Elaichi Kulfi, we will first make an almond paste.
1. Remove the skin of the soaked almonds and add them to a blender along with 1 cup of milk and blend to a smooth paste.
1. Keep aside.
1. Next in a heavy bottomed pan, add milk and bring it to a boil.
1. Reduce the heat once the milk boils and then simmer the milk on medium heat till the milk in the pan reduces to half its original quantity.
1. Stir occasionally and scrape the sides to avoid the milk from burning and sticking to the pan.
1. This process of reducing the milk will take a good 20-25 minutes.
1. Once the milk has reduced, add the saffron strands and the cardamom powder.
1. Add the ground Almond milk and the sugar and mix till all the sugar has dissolved.
1. Once done turn off the flame and allow the badam elaichi kulfi mixture to cool down completely.
1. Once it is cooled spoon the Badam Elaichi Kulfi mixture into kulfi molds along with some chopped pistachios.
1. Close the lid and freeze for 8 hours until the kulfi is set.
1. Serve Badam Elaichi Kulfi along with a party meal of Homemade Butter Naan, Paneer Makhani and Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita Recipe.
