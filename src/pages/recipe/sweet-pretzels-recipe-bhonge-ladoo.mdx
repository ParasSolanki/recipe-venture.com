### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 1 cup Jaggery.
- 2 tablespoons Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- 1-1/3 cup Water - divided.
- 1-1/4 cup Wheat Bran - plus 2 tablespoons.
- Sunflower Oil - as required.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Sweet Pretzels Recipe, prepare the dough for the pretzels first.
1. In a big mixing bowl, add the wheat bran, about 4 teaspoons of cooking oil, and salt.
1. Add about 1/3 cup of water (add little by little), prepare a tight and pliable dough, kneading well for about 4 to 5 minutes.
1. Keep this dough aside for 30 minutes, brushed lightly with oiled fingers.
1. Cover the dough with a moist cloth or plate while it is resting.
1. Take small portions of dough and roll them in about 5 inch long cylindrical shapes.
1. Give it desired shape (here I have given pretzels type shape).
1. Keep these pretzels in open plate for roughly one hour.
1. (You can also keep it in sun)Heat sufficient cooking oil in a kadai; once it is hot, add each pretzel carefully and fry in batches till they crisp up.
1. *For Jaggery Syrup:Lightly toast 2 table spoons of that extra wheat bran for some time in a pan.
1. Keep aside.
1. Lightly toast sesame seeds till browning a bit and keep aside.
1. Make syrup by boiling together 1 cup of Jaggery and 1 cup of water for 8-10 minutes.
1. After a while when the syrup is still warm, add toasted wheat bran and sesame seeds to it.
1. Mix well.
1. This thickens the syrup a bit.
1. *For Assembling:Assemble the fried pretzels in shallow container.
1. Pour jaggery syrup over it and let it sit in it for 2-3 hours.
1. This makes the pretzels soak the syrup and make them nice and sweet.
1. .
1. Garnish with more toasted sesame seeds before serving.
1. Serve Sweet Pretzels Recipe or Bhonde Ladoo as a sweet evening snack with Masala Chai Recipe or as a dessert aftre your everyday meals.
