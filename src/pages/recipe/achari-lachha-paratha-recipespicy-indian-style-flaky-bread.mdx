### Ingredients

- Water - to knead the dough.
- 1/2 cup Punjabi style mango pickle.
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- Ghee - to roast the parathas.
- 1 teaspoon Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Achari Lachha Paratha we will first knead to make the dough.
1. In a large mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour, salt and mix it well.
1. Add a tablespoon of oil and rub it into the flour until you see coarse crumbs.
1. Add a little water at a time and knead well to make a smooth and soft paratha dough.
1. Cover the dough and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.
1. After 10 minutes, knead for a minute again until the paratha dough is soft and pliable.
1. Divide the dough into equal portions.
1.  Preheat a skillet on medium heat.
1. If you are using a cast iron skillet, then grease the skillet well and allow it to preheat.
1. Keep some flour aside for dusting while rolling the dough.
1. Shape each dough portion into a round ball, press it between the palm of your hands.
1. Dust the dough in flour and roll it into a small or 6 inch diameter circle.
1. Generously smear the achaari masala from the mango pickle on this rolled out dough.
1. Dust some flour over the achaari masala.
1. This flour and oil from the pickle will help the lachha paratha split itself into layers.
1. Begin folding the lachha paratha dough like saree pleat.
1. Start from one end of the rolled out dough and reach the end.
1. Basically, fold it starting from the side towards you and moving away just the way you would fold a hand fan.
1. Folding one small layer over another and so on.
1. The dough is essentially shaped into a pleat.
1. Once you have stacked up all the pleats one over the other, start rolling it into a tight circle like that of a swiss roll.
1. Flatten the pleated swiss roll between the palm of your hands, dust in flour and roll into a 4 to 5 inch diameter circle.
1. You will be able to see the layers very clearly.
1. Place the rolled layered Achaari Lachha Paratha on the preheated skillet.
1. Cook on medium heat on both sides for a few seconds, then smear ghee and cook until golden brown and cooked through completely.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining portions of the paratha dough.
1. Serve the Achari Lachha Paratha along with Creamy Dal Makhani Recipe and Masala Chaas Recipe (Indian Spiced Buttermilk) for a hearty Sunday lunch.
