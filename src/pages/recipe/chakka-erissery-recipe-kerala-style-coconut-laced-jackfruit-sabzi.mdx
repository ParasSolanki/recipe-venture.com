### Instructions

1. To begin making Chakka Erissery Recipe, let us first cut the raw jackfruit.
1. In order to do that we have to first, grease our hands and the knife that we are going to use, with some oil.
1. This important tip ensures that the hands don't get sticky from the natural fruit latex/sap present in the fruit does not get onto your hands and makes the cutting process hassle-free.
1. Keep a bowl of water mixed with some salt, ready to put the cut raw jackfruit pieces to avoid discolouration of the fruit.
1. Now that your hands and knife are well greased, cut the the jackfruit in half, discard the skin and start making 1 inch pieces and soak them in the salted water.
1. Place the jackfruit in a pressure cooker with 1/4 cup of water and turmeric powder, red chilli powder, pepper powder and salt.
1. Pressure cook for 1 whistle and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. In a mixer grinder, combine the grated coconut, and cumin seeds into a fine smooth paste along with some water.
1. Once the pressure from the pressure cooker has released naturally, open the lid, add the coconut masala and return to flame.
1. Cook on medium low heat for 3-4 minutes with no lid on, stirring continuously so that it does not get burnt down.
1. turn off the flame.
1. Heat coconut oil in a tadka pan on low heat.
1. Once the oil is hot, add mustard seeds, when they splutter, add garlic, dry red chillies, curry leaves and coconut pieces and fry  for 2-3 minutes and turn off the in a few seconds.
1. Add this tadka to the Chakka Erissery.
