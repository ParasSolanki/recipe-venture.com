### Ingredients

- 2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1/2 cup Icing Sugar.
- 2 cups Caster Sugar.
- 2 teaspoons Baking powder.
- 113 grams Butter (unsalted) - softened.
- 1 cup Cocoa Powder - unsweetened.
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.
- 2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract.
- 4 Whole Eggs.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chocolate Crinkle Cookies, first cream together the sugar and butter using a hand blender.
1. When it is pale and light, beat in eggs one at a time, and mix till well combined.
1. Then stir in the vanilla.
1. Once mixed add in the cocoa powder slowly making sure to mix uniformly.
1. Next, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt and add into the cocoa mixture.
1. Mix very well.
1. The dough will be very, very sticky.
1. Spoon the dough onto a cling film, wrap it and refrigerate overnight or longer.
1. The longer the dough is chilled, the easier it will be to handle.
1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
1. Divide the dough into three parts.
1. With one part make 1-inch balls and place them on the parchment-lined cookie sheet.
1. Dampen your palms while making the balls and make them as smooth as possible.
1. Chill the cookies for 10-15 minutes to firm them up again.
1. Put the icing sugar in a bowl.
1. Roll each chilled dough ball in the sugar, making sure to coat the cookie as much as possible.
1. Place the cookie balls back onto the parchment-lined cookie sheets.
1. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes.
1. Do not overbake or they will get very hard.
1. Once done, take the tray out and let it rest on a cooling rack.
1. Repeat this with the other two parts as well.
1. Store prepared cookies in an airtight container and serve the Chocolate Crinkle Cookies with a cold glass of milk.
