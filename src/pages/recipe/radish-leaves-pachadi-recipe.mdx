### Instructions

1. To prepare Radish Leaves Pachadi Recipe, prep up with all the ingredients required.
1. Heat oil in a pan, add half of mustard seeds, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds.
1. When they start spluttering, add hing.
1. Add in green chillies, red chillies, and fry for a few seconds.
1. Add chopped tomatoes and radish greens, garlic and cook them till the raw smell goes off, or the tomatoes turn mushy.
1. Allow to cool.
1. Meanwhile again heat the pan and prepare tadka.
1. Meanwhile, again heat another pan and prepare tadka by heating a little oil and adding remaining mustard seeds, black gram, fenugreek seeds, one red chilli and curry leaves.
1. When they start spluttering, switch off the flame and keep it aside.
1. By now the above radish leaves and tomato mixture might have cooled.
1. Add them to a blender jar, add salt, turmeric powder, and tamarind.
1. Grind it to make a coarse chutney, add water if necessary.
1. Pour tadka to the chutney and give it a quick stir just before serving, since the crunch of urad dal is great when the tadka is freshly added.
