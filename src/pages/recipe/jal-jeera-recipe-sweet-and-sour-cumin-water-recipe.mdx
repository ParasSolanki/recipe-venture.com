### Instructions

1. To begin making the Jal Jeera Recipe, wash mint leaves and cilantro leaves and keep aside.
1. Peel & slice pineapple.
1. Using a juicer, extract juice and strain it twice to procure clear pineapple juice.
1. Grind the dry spices using a spice grinder and then add the tamarind paste, mint leaves and cilantro leaves.
1. Using 3 to 4 tablespoons of water, make a fine paste.
1. Strain the paste twice so you have a clear concentrated paste.
1. (I used a regular sieve for the first straining and a finely meshed one for the second) Transfer this to a pot or jug.
1. In a measuring jar, add the pineapple juice and top the rest with water so that you have a total amount of 650 ml (approximately) of liquid.
1. Add sugar and stir well to dissolve.
1. Pour this liquid in the concentrated paste and stir well.
1. Jal Jeera is ready; chill it and sprinkle boondi before serving.
1. Serve Jal Jeera as an appetizer or a digestive drink.
1. Serve the Jal Jeera Recipe (Sweet And Sour Cumin Water Recipe) along with Aloo Tikki Chaat and Samosa for your evening get togethers.
