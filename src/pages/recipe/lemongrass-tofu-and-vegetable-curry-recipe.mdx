1. Once the vegetables are cooked, pour in the Lemon grass curry mixture along with the tofu and stir to combine.
1. Turn the heat to medium high and bring the curry to a boil.
1. After a minute of boiling, turn off the heat and transfer the curry to a serving bowl.
1. Serve the Tofu and Vegetable Curry along with brown rice or even Thai Jasmine Sticky Rice Recipe, Papaya Orange Pomegranate Salad Recipe With Roasted Peanuts and Coconut Tapioca Pudding Recipe with Spicy Strawberry Sauce for as healthy wholesome weeknight dinner.
