1.  Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. In a kadai, heat oil on medium flame, once the oil is hot, add the whole spices- cumin seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves.
1. Once the spices begin to sizzle, add the whole wheat flour and mix well along with the oil and spices.

1. Once it thickens, add salt and pepper, and mutton and all the contents of the pressure cooker into the kadai.
1.  Give the Mutton Khurdi/ Bohra Style White Mutton Soup a brisk boil for 3 to 4 minutes until all the flavours get into the mutton.
