### Ingredients

- 1 Red Bell pepper (Capsicum) - finely chopped.
- 500 grams Kaddu (Parangikai/ Pumpkin) - peeled and diced.
- 1 tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- Salt - to taste.
- 4 cloves Garlic - finely chopped.
- 1/4 cup Britannia Cream Cheese - flavored like jalepeno or peppers works great.
- 200 ml Milk.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Creamy Pumpkin Pasta Sauce Recipe; first get all the ingredients ready and keep it by the side.
1. Heat oil in a wok on medium heat, add in the garlic, red peppers and pumpkin.
1. Sprinkle some salt and stir fry to combine for a couple of minutes.
1. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and allow the pumpkin and peppers to cook until soft and tender.
1. Do make sure to keep stirring intermittently so the vegetables dont get burnt.
1. You will know the pumpkin is cooked, when you press it down with a fork or a spoon, it will mash itself up.
1. Turn off the heat.
1. Now we are ready to blend all the ingredients together into the blender.
1. Note: If your blender does not allow hot ingredients, then allow the pumpkin to cool before blending it.
1. I use a KitchenAid Diamond Blender and that blends even hot ingredients without splashing all over.
1. If your blender can take in hot inrgedients, then add all of it right away.
1. Add all the ingredients like the cooked pumpkin, peppers, milk and cream cheese into the blender and blend to make a smooth puree.
1. Once blended, check the salt and pepper levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. The creamy pumpkin puree can now be used as a pasta sauce for lasagna's or even regular pastas.
1. Store the Creamy Pumpkin Sauce in a glass jar or bottle, and refrigerate it for a maximum of 3 to 4 days and use it as and when required to make fresh pasta.
