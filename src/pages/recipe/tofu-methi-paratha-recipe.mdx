- 1/4 cup Bajra Flour ( Pearl Millet).
- 1 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera).
- 1 cup Tofu - crumbled.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1-1/2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.

- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1/4 cup Jowar Flour (Sorghum).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Tofu Methi Paratha Recipe, we will first make the dough for the parathas.
1. In a large bowl add whole wheat flour and some salt.
1. Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough.
1. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
1. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.
1. Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more.
1. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.
1. Next we will divide the dough into 6 equal portions and keep aside.
1. While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas.
1. In a large bowl; add tofu, onion, chopped methi leaves, green chillies, cumin powder, and salt.
1. Combine all the ingredients well.
1. Divide the filling into 6 equal portions.
1. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.
1. Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down.
1. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface.
1. Place this rolled dough to the side.
1. Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.
1. Now place a portion of the tofu methi paratha filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around.
1. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.
1. Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the tofu methi paratha.
1. Once sealed press down the tofu methi paratha with your palms to release any air pockets.
1. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.
1. Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a tofu methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.
1. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.
1. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the tofu methi paratha.
1. Flip again, so the oiled side of the tofu methi paratha can cook on the skillet.
1. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the tofu methi paratha while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.
1. Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly.
1. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the tofu methi paratha to get a crisp on the outside and yet have soft texture.
1. Once the tofu methi paratha is cooked transfer it to a plate and serve.
1. Serve the Tofu Methi Paratha Recipe along with a Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita Recipe and Pisarna Manga Recipe  for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
