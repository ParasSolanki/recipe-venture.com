### Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons Ghee.
- 1 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 2 tablespoons Chiroti Rava.
- 1/3 cup Lukewarm Water.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pheki Mathai Recipe, first mix the dry ingredients - maida and sooji together.
1. Add the ghee to the mixture and rub between your fingers till the dough turns crumbly and resembles breadcrumbs.
1. Gradually add warm water, little at a time, while bringing the dough together into a ball.
1. Knead for 3-4 minutes till the dough stops sticking and comes together into a neat ball.
1. Cover with a muslin cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
1. After 30 minutes, divide the dough into 8 equal parts.
1. Make balls and keep aside for 5 minutes.
1. Now roll the mathris out by rolling each ball into a disc about 1/4 inch thick and 5-6 inch diameter.
1. Poke the rolled out mathri with fork or knife so that it doesn't fluff up while frying.
1. Next, to deep fry the mathri, heat sufficient oil in a kadai.
1. Fry the mathris for 2-3 minutes on each side till golden brown.
1. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and keep aside to cool.
1. Allow the mathris to cool completely, and then store them in an airtight container.
