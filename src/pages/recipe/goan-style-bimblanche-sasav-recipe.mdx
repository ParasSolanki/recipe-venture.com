### Ingredients

- 2 Green Chillies.
- 20 Grams Jaggery.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 Tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1 Cup Water.
- 6 Bimbla (Bilimbi).
- 1 teaspoons Mustard seeds.
- 1/2 Cup Fresh coconut - grated.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Goan Style Bimblanche Sasav Recipe, take washed bimbla in a medium saucepan and add about a cup of water.
1. Boil on high heat till they soften up.
1. Do not throw away water, since you can use it for grinding later.
1. Toast coconut in a kadai with a bit of oil on low heat till it is slightly browned.
1. Turn off the flame and transfer to a separate plate for it to cool.
1. In the same pan, a bit of oil and fry green chillies for a few seconds and keep aside.
1. Roast mustard seeds in the same pan and keep aside.
1. Take toasted coconut, green chillies and mustard seeds in the mixer grinder along with jaggery and salt.
1. Add a little water we used for boiling bimbla and grind everything for about a minute.
1. Refrain from adding more water since we need the consistency of the raita to be very thick like coconut chutney.
1. Now add in boiled bimbla and grind for few seconds till it is nicely mixed and mushy.
1. Serve Goan Style Bimblanche Sasav Recipe as a side dish along with Feijoada Recipe (Spicy Goan Black Eyed Peas Stew), pav, and steamed rice.
