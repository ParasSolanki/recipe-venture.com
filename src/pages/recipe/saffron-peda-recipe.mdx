### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon Ghee - optional.
- 1 tablespoon Pistachios - sliced.
- 4 tablespoons Sugar.
- 300 grams Khoya (Mawa) - store bought or home made.
- 1/4 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2 tablespoons Milk.
- 1 teaspoon Saffron strands.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kesar Peda Recipe, gently warm the milk without boiling it and soak the saffron in it.
1. Keep this aside for 10 minutes.
1. In a pan or kadai, add crumbled khoya and sugar.
1. Cook this on a low heat for 4-5 minutes stirring continuously until the sugar is completely dissolved.
1. The khoya will first melt and then thicken again.
1. Stir continuously till the khoya thickens and be careful not to burn the khoya.
1.  Once the khoya has thickened, add saffron milk and powdered cardamom to it.
1. Cook for a few more minutes till the khoya thickens up considerably and resembles a sticky dough like consistency and stars leaving the sides of the pan.
1. At this stage, turn off the heat and allow the peda mixture to cool.
1. Once the mixture is cool enough to touch, knead it lightly to get rid of any lumps so you have a smooth mixture.
1. You can add a little ghee at this stage to give it a good shine.
1. Roll the kesar peda mixture into a log and cut 12 equal pieces.
1. Roll each of peda portions into small balls, make a small dent in the center and add the pista slices.
1. Or you could use a peda mould if you have one, like shown in the image.
1. Once shaped the Kesar Peda is ready to be served.
1. Serve the Kesar Peda as a dessert along with a festive meal of Tandoori Gobi Tikka Recipe, Hariyali Paneer Tikka Masala Gravy Recipe and Modur Pulao With Pomegranate Recipe.
