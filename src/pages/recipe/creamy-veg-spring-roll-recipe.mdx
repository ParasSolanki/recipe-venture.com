- 3 tablespoon Eggless Mayonnaise.
- 1 Carrot (Gajjar) - chopped finely.
- 1/2 cup Cabbage (Patta Gobi/ Muttaikose) - finely shredded.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Creamy Veg Spring Roll Recipe, prep all the vegetables and keep it ready.
1. Make the spring roll wrappers according to the recipe and keep them aside.
1. In a small bowl, make a mixture of the all purpose flour (maida) and add just enough water to make a thick paste.
1. This will be used to seal the spring rolls.
1. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat; add the carrots, bell peppers and cabbage and saute for 10 minutes until softened.
1. Toss in the noodles and sprinkle the salt and pepper to taste.
1. Stir in the Del Monte Eggless Mayo into the spring roll mixture and keep aside.
1. Place each spring roll wrapper on a flat surface.
1. Apply a little flour paste along the edges of the wrapper.
1. Place a tablespoon of the filling at one corner/edge of the wrapper.
1. Watch this video on how to shape the spring rollFold in from the filled corner and begin rolling until you reach the center.
1. When you reach the center, fold the ends arising from the center.
1. At this stage, apply the flour paste again on the edges and roll until you reach the end.
1. Make sure the edges are sealed well.
1. The flour paste is important as it helps to seal the spring rolls so they don't open up when deep-fried.
1. Repeat the same process and proceed to make the rest of the spring rolls.
1. Preheat the oil for deep frying; add in a few rolls at a time and deep fry on medium heat until golden brown in color.
1. Serve the Creamy Veg Spring Roll Recipe along with a sweet tomato sauce and a glass of Apple Almond Date Smoothie Recipe as a fun snack for the kids.
