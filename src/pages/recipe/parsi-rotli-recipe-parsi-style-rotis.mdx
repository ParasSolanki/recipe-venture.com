### Ingredients

- Ghee - for serving.
- Water - as required.
- 1/4 cup Milk.
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt - optional.
- 1 teaspoon Ghee - 1 teaspoon ghee.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Parsi Rotli recipe, first bring all the ingredients together and we will make the dough.
1. In a large bowl combine the flour and salt; add the milk and a little water at a time to make firm dough.
1. Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead until smooth.
1. Set the dough aside to rest covered for 15 minutes.
1. Knead once again and divide the dough into equal portions.
1. Preheat the iron skillet on medium low heat.
1. Roll the portions of rotli dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.
1. Take a portion of the rotli dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter.
1. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.
1. Place rolled dough on the hot skillet.
1. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form.
1. At this point flip the rolled dough to the other side on the skillet.
1. Press the rotli with a folded kitchen napkin.
1. Keep pressing on the surface of the rotli until it completely puffs up.
1. This has to be done on low flame to ensure there are no brown spots.
1. Remove the rotli from heat, place it on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.
1. Serve Parsi Rotli along with Ringan Ravaiya Recipe (Parsi Style Stuffed Eggplant Recipe) and Iranian Berry Pulao Recipe With Caramelized Onion & Cranberry for a simple Parsi meal.
