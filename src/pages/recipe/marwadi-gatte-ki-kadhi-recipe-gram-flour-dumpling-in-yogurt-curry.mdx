### Instructions

1. To begin making the Marwadi Gatte Ki Kadhi Recipe (Gram Flour Dumpling In Yogurt Curry Recipe), we will first make the gatte.
1. In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for the gatte including gram flour, red chilli powder, ajwain, curd, salt and knead to make a stiff dough.
1. Add a little water if required.
1. Divide the gatte mixture into 8 to 10 small portions, and shape into a small cylindrical roll.
1. Keep it aside.
1. The next step is to cook the gatte.
1. Heat water in the saucepan and bring it to a roaring boil.
1. Place the gatte in the boiling water and allow it to cook for about 7 to 8 minutes.
1. You will notice the gatte rising to the top.
1. After 7 to 8 minutes, drain the gatte from the water and keep aside.
1. In a small pestle and motor, pound the garlic and green chilies to make a coarse paste.
1. The next step is to make the kadhi.
1. In a large saucepan, whisk the yogurt along with the gram flour in a mixing bowl.
1. Add 2 cups of water to make a smooth batter.
1. Add the coarse paste and turmeric powder.
1. Place the saucepan over high heat, add the kadhi mixture into it and bring the kadhi to a boil.
1. Keep whisking while the kadhi boils to bring the mixture to a homogeneous consistency.
1. Once the kadhi thickens, turn the heat to low, add the gatte and allow it to simmer for another 5 minutes.
1. While the Gatte ki Kadhi is simmering, we will proceed to make the tadka.
1. Heat ghee over medium heat in a tadka pan, add the cumin seeds, red chili, and cinnamon and saute for a few seconds.
1. Add the tadka to the Gatte ki Kadhi, stir in the coriander leaves and serve.
