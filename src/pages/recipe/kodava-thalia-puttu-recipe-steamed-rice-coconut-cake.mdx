- 1/4 teaspoon Baking soda.
- 1 cup Coconut milk.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kodava Thalia Puttu Recipe - Steamed Rice & Coconut Cakes, we will soak the uncooked rice and fenugreek seeds with enough water in a bowl.
1. We will soak the rice for at least 6 hours.
1. After soaking the rice, drain out the soaked water and keep some soaked water aside to grind.
1. Add in soaked rice, fenugreek seeds, urad dal and some of the soaked water into a mixer and grind it to form a smooth batter.
1. Later add the remaining cooked rice and some more of the soaked rice and grind it again to form a smooth batter.
1. Transfer the batter into a mixing bowl, add coconut milk, sugar and mix thoroughly.
1. Keep this batter covered using a muslin cloth or a plate and keep it near a warm place.
1. This will help in fermenting the batter well.
1. You can ferment the batter overnight and the next day you will see some bubbles on top and the dough would have risen little.
1. Open the lid, add salt to taste and baking soda and mix well.
1. Keep an idli steamed on over medium heat with some water.
1. Grease the pan well with some oil, and pour in the Thalia puttu batter and carefully place it inside the steamer.
1. Steam the Thalia Puttu for at least 15 minutes.
1. You can insert a skewer and see if it is cooked, once it comes out clean then you know that it is cooked well.
1. Serve the Kodava Thalia Puttu Recipe along with North Karnataka Style Nuggekai Kharbyaali and Coconut Chutney by the side for your morning breakfast meals.
