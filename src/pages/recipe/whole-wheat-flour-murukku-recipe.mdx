### Ingredients

- Sunflower Oil - for deep frying.
- 1 teaspoon Salt.
- Water - as required.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 2 teaspoon Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- 1 teaspoon Ajwain (Carom seeds).
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 tablespoon Butter (unsalted) - melted.

### Instructions

1. To begin  making the Whole Wheat Flour Murukku, in a cotton cloth place the Vivatta chakki atta, bring 2 opposite ends of the cloth and tie them together.
1. Now bring the other 2 opposite ends and tie them too.
1. The flour should be completed covered by the cloth.
1. Place this cloth in a bowl and place that inside a steamer making sure cloth does not turn the water.
1. Steam the atta for about 15 to 20 minutes.
1. After steaming, remove the cloth from the steamer, open the ends and leave it open for few minutes until it cools down so you can handle the flour.
1. Now break the flour as fine as you can and then sieve it to make sure no lumps are present.
1. To the fine flour, add red chili powder, salt, white sesame seeds, ajwain, and hot melted butter.
1. Mix everything with your fingertips until it resembles bread crumb like texture.
1. Add water little at a time and knead.
1. Make a soft and stiff dough and keep the dough covered and away from stove, else the dough will turn too dry.
1. Heat oil in a wide pan on medium flame.
1. While oil is heating, fill the press with murukku mix.
1. Squeeze out the murukku over a greased ladle and drop them gently into the hot oil.
1. Once you drop the murukku, turn flame to medium.
1. Wait until the murukku releases the ladle by itself (if you find that murukku is not leaving the spotted ladle, you can gently push the murukku using another ladle after itâ€™s cooked on one side, mine released by itself).
1. Fry them in oil until golden brown on both side.
1. You will notice that the bubbles in the oil is reduced which indicates murukku is down.
1. Remove from oil and place it on a kitchen towel to absorb excess oil.
1. Once it completely cools, store in air tight container and enjoy them for a longer time.
1. Serve Vivatta Whole Wheat Flour Murukku with hot Adrak Chai Recipe during your tea time break.
