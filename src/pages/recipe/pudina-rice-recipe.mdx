### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Tamarind Paste.
- 1 teaspoon White Urad Dal (Split).
- 2 teaspoons Sunflower Oil.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- 1 cup Rice.
- 2-1/2 cups Mint Leaves (Pudina).
- 3 Green Chillies - slit.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pudina Rice Recipe, we first have to cook the rice.
1. I most often like to use a day old rice for making Pudina rice, but you can cook fresh rice as well.
1. Cook the rice with 2 cups of water along with a little salt and a tablespoon of oil until all the water is absorbed.
1. Allow the cooked rice to rest for a while and use it to make the Pudina Rice only after it has completely cooled down.
1. Or to cook rice in a pressure cooker follow Steamed Rice Recipe - Pressure Cooker.
1. while the rice is cooling we will make the pudina masala.
1. Wash the pudina leaves.
1. Using a mixer grinder, grind the pudina leaves along with the green chillies and tamarind into a smooth paste.
1. Heat the oil on medium heat; add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Stir in the urad dal and roast it until it turns light golden brown.
1. Add the onions and saute until the onions turn translucent.
1. Once done add the ground pudina mixture and salt.
1. Give it a stir and let it cook for 5 minutes until the mixture turns a little thick.
1. Turn off the heat and finally stir in the cooked rice to this mixture until well combined.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Transfer Pudina Rice into a serving bowl.
1. Serve Pudina Rice along with Tadka Raita or Beetroot Raita and Elai Vadam  for your lunch or you can also pack it in your lunch box.
