### Instructions

1. To begin making Mushroom, Paneer And Soya Chunk Samosa Recipe first boil some water with salt in a sauce pan.
1. To this, add the soya chunks/granules.
1. Turn off the heat and cover the saucepan and set it aside for 15 minutes until the chunks/granules double in size.
1. Then, using a large strainer, drain all the water.
1. Place the soya chunks/granules in a bowl and set them aside to cool down.
1. Mince the mushrooms by pulsing them a couple of times in a food processor.
1. Add the cooked soya chunks into the food processor as well and pulse a couple more times till they are mixed well.
1. Set this mixture aside.
1. Heat a pan with oil.
1. To it, add fennel seeds.
1. After a few seconds add the chopped onions and chopped green chilli as well.
1. Saute them until they are slightly golden.
1. Once the onions are golden in colour add the crumbled paneer, along with the mushroom and soya mix, to the pan.
1. Sprinkle some salt and cook it together until the water has evaporated completely.
1. Add the ground pepper, Kashmiri chilli powder, turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala and chaat powder and mix well till combined.
1. Check the seasonings and add some more salt if needed and cook until the mixture is completely dry.
1. Take the Mushroom, Paneer And Soya Chunk mix off the heat, set it aside and allow it to cool down completely.
1. The mixture must come down to room temperature so that it is warm enough to handle.
1. The next step is to prepare the samosas.
1. To do this, take one sheet of spring roll pastry and place it vertically on a board or work surface.
1. Place a spoonful of the stuffing and fold the sheets into a triangles.
1. To seal the samosa like a pouch, smear some water at the end of the fold to make the open ends stick together.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining sheets, until the samosa filling is used fully.
1. Arrange the  prepared samosas on a board and keep covered with a damp cloth until you are ready to fry them.
1. In a kadai, warm some oil for deep frying.
1. When the oil is hot enough, gently slide 2-3 samosas in.
1. Take care not to over-crowd the kadai, so that the samosas fry evenly and turn golden brown.
1. When ready, gently ease them out with a slotted spoon, taking care to drain out all the excess oil along the sides of the kadhai.
1. Place the samosas on oil absorbent paper and allow the oil to drain completely.
1. Serve Mushroom, Paneer And Soya Chunk Samosa along with Green Chutney or Date and Tamarind Chutney and Ginger Cardamom Chai for a evening snack.
