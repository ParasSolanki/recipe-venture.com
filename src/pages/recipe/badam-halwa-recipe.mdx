### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Ghee.
- 3/4 cup Sugar.
- 1 cup Badam (Almond).
- 3/4 cup Milk.
- 1 tablespoon Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 tablespoons Slivered Almonds (Badam).
- 3 Saffron strands.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Badam Halwa Recipe, combine the almonds and enough water in a deep bowl and soak for 8 hours.
1. Drain and de-skin the almonds.
1. Blend the almonds in a mixer to get a coarse mixture without using any water or milk.
1. Keep this badam mixture aside.
1. The next step is to make the badam halwa.
1. In a saucepan, add the milk, 1/2 cup water, sugar and saffron.
1. Dissolve the sugar in the milk mixture and keep the heat on low so the milk mixture stays warm.
1. Heat ghee in a Heavy Bottomed Pan, add the ground badam mixture and roast in the ghee over medium heat for about 7 to 8 minutes, stirring continuously.
1. The badam mixture will change in color slightly and get a roasted aroma.
1. Once the badam is well roasted and has a good aroma, slowly stir in the warm milk mixture into the halwa.
1. At this stage the halwa will begin to sizzle and liquid will start spluttering everywhere.
1. Keep stirring the badam halwa until all the milk is evaporated and the badam halwa comes away from the sides of the pan.
1. Once you notice the badam halwa comes away from the sides of the pan, turn off the heat.
1. Stir in the slivered almonds and serve.
1. Serve the Badam Halwa as a sweet for the festivals like diwali or a special occasion like a wedding in the family.
1. Serve Badam Halwa after a delicious festive meal of Aloo Tamatar Ki Sabzi, Ajwain Puri and Boondi Raita.
