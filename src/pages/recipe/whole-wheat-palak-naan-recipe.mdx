### Ingredients

- 1 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).
- 1 teaspoon Baking soda.
- Ghee - for smearing on naan.
- Kalonji (Onion Nigella Seeds) - or sesame seeds to sprinkle.
- 1/2 cup Spinach Leaves (Palak) - finely chopped (tightly packed).
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/2 teaspoon Sugar.
- 1-1/2 teaspoon Salt - (adjust to taste).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Wheat Palak Naan, first add the flour, palak, salt, sugar, baking soda, oil into a mixing bowl and combine.
1. Make a well in the center and all curd and begin to knead the dough together.
1. Work it until it is a smooth dough dough.
1. Add water if needed so make it a soft and slightly sticky dough.
1. Do not be tempted to add more flour, the dough needs to be on the wetter/stickier side.
1. Rub oil all over the dough, cover and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
1. When ready to make the naans, divide the dough into 6-8 equal parts.
1. Taking each portion at a time, dust a little flour if needed to roll and using a rolling pin or fingers, press the portion out into a thick, flat disc shaped like a naan.
1. Rub water over the rolled out naan and sprinkle sesame seeds, kalonji seeds, and finely chopped palak leaves.
1. Place a skillet on the heat and when it is warm enough, place the rolled naan over a hot tawa with the side sprinkled with kalonji facing the top.
1. Cover and cook for about a minute on medium low flame.
1. Now lift the tawa off the heat and flip the naan over, directly on to the heat.
1. This ensures you get a charred smoky flavor to the naan, mimicking the tandoori flavour.
1. Once done, take the naan off the heat/tawa and rub with ghee.
1. Repeat with rest of the dough and serve hot naans with Mushroom Pasanda or Green Moong Dal Makhani.
