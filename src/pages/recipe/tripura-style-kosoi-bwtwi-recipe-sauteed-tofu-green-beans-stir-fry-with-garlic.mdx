### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons Sunflower Oil.
- Salt - to taste.
- Black pepper powder - to taste.
- 2 Green Chillies - slit vertically.
- 2 cups Green beans (French Beans) - chopped to 1-inch & parboiled.
- 1 cloves Garlic - chopped.
- 1/4 cup Onion - chopped.
- 100 grams Tofu - cubed.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Tripura Style Kosoi Bwtwi Recipe, parboil the green beans in a steamer.
1. Meanwhile cut the tofu and stir fry them on a shallow frying pan with a few drops of cooking oil for about a minute on each side.
1. Once you take out the tofu, in the same shallow frying pan, heat the oil (I have used olive oil to make the recipe more healthy and interesting) and saute onions, garlic cloves, chopped green chillies and saute till the raw smell goes away.
1. Once the raw smell goes away and the veggies are tender, add green beans along with sauteed tofu and stir fry for a few minutes.
1. Add salt and pepper as per taste, mix everything well and serve hot.
1. Serve Tripura Style Kosoi Bwtwi Recipe as a side dish along with a meal of Steamed Rice, Assamese Bilahi Boror Tenga Recipe (Sour Curry With Red Lentil Fritters) and Garlic Dal.
