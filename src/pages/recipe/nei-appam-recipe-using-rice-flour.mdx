### Instructions

1. To begin making the Nei Appam recipe, firstly take water and jaggery in a saucepan and boil it till the jaggery dissolves.
1. Once the mixture comes to a rolling boil, switch off the flame.
1. Let it cool completely.
1. Mash the bananas using a fork well.
1. Add this to the rice flour and give it a good mix.
1. Add jaggery syrup, cardamom powder and baking soda and give it a good mix.
1. Cover it and let it rest for 2 hours.
1. After 2 hours, mix the mixture using a spoon.
1. If it has thickened, add a little water to loosen the mixture.
1. The batter should be a thick batter but in pouring consistency.
1. Heat the paniyaram pan on a flame that can heat it evenly.
1. Add 1/2 teaspoon of ghee into every slot.
1. Add a tablespoon of batter into each slot.
1. Cover it and cook for 1/2 a minute or till it is golden and crisp.
1. But the centre should be still runny.
1. Carefully using a spoon flip the appams.
1. Fry the other side till it turns golden in colour as well and crisp.
1. Serve hot with ghee.
1. Flipping the appams when the centre is still runny will get nice round appams.
