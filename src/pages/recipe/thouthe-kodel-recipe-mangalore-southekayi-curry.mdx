### Instructions

1. Place the toor dal in the pressure cooker along with 1-1/2 cups of water, turmeric powder and salt.
1. Cover the pan, pressure cook until you hear one whistle.
1. After the first whistle, turn the heat to low and simmer the dal for about 3 to 4 minutes.
1. After 3 to 4 minutes, turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally, as the dal will continue to cook in the pressure cooker under pressure.
1. Once done, whisk the dal until smooth and keep aside.
1. The next step is to cook the Mangalore Cucumber (Touthe) along with the tamarind water.
1. Place the cut Mangalore Cucumber (Touthe) and the tamarind water in the pressure cooker.

1. Allow it to pressure cook until you heat 2 to three whistles.
1. After the whistles, turn off the heat.
1. Place the pressure cooker under cold running water to release the pressure immediately.
1. Cucumber cooks very fast, so its important to release the pressure immediately, so it does not become mushy.
1. The next step is to make the Masala for the Mangalore Cucumber Curry (Touthe).
1. In small pan; dry roast the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, urad dal, fenugreek seeds, pepper corns and red chillies until you can smell the roasted aromas coming through.
1. Place the roasted ingredients along with the coconut and garlic into a food processor and blend to make a smooth paste.
1. The final step is to combine all the ingredients.
1. In a large sauce pan; add in the cooked and whisked dal, the cucumber tamarind curry and the masala paste.
1. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
1. Place the sauce pan on medium heat and give the Thouthe Kodel a boil.
1. Once it begins to boil, turn the heat to low and simmer until we get the seasoning ready.
1. To prepare the seasoning for the Thouthe Kodel; heat oil in a small pan; add all the seasoning ingredients.
1. Allow the seeds to crackle and roast.
1. Stir for a couple of seconds until you can smell the aromas coming through.
