### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Rice.
- 5 Saffron strands.
- 2 tablespoons Badam (Almond) - thinly sliced.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2 Mango (Ripe) - peeled and diced.
- 2 tablespoons Pistachios - thinly sliced.
- 1/2 cup Sugar.
- 1 liter Milk.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mango Phirni Recipe, wash and soak the rice for 2-3 hours.
1. Drain and pat dry on an absorbent cloth.
1. Once the rice is dry, blend into a coarse powder - the texture will be similar to semolina.
1. Puree half the mangoes and keep the other half in cut pieces.
1. In a heavy bottomed pan; add the milk and bring it to a roaring boil.
1. Once it begins to boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk until it condenses to half its volume.
1. Keep stirring the milk while it is simmering.
1.  This process of reducing the milk adds to the richness of the phirni.
1. Once the milk is reduced to half add the ground rice to milk.
1. You will notice that the milk will begin to thicken.
1. Once it starts thickening, add the sugar, cardamom powder and saffron.
1. You might want to add some more milk, if the milk has thickened a little too much.
1. Adjust the consistency as desired.
1. Keep stirring the phirni for another 5 to 10 minutes till the mixture attains its full flavor and has an almost pudding-like consistency.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the phirni to cool completely.
1. Once cooled, stir in the pureed mangoes into the phirni and refrigerate for at least 5 hours.
1. Once you are ready to serve, spoon the Mango Phirni them into small glasses or cups, sprinkle with the sliced pistachios and almonds and serve.
1. Serve the Mango Phirni as a dessert after a delicious North Indian Meal or even after a simple sunday lunch for the family.
