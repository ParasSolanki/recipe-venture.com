### Instructions

1. To begin making the Amla Methi Sukhi Sabzi Recipe, we need to first boil the amla.
1. In a saucepan, add water and bring to a rolling boil.
1. To the boiling water add the whole, washed and cleaned amla.
1. After about 4-5 minutes, turn off the heat.
1. Drain the excess water and transfer the amla into a bowl and allow it to cool.
1. Once cooled, remove the seeds from the amla, by making a slit on one of the sides and you will see the quarters fall apart.
1. Using a knife, cut the amla into quarters and set aside.
1. Heat a kadai with oil on medium flame, add the oil .

1. At this stage, add in the onions, and saute until they turn transparent, this will take about 3-4 minutes on medium -high heat.
1. Once the onions have softened and cooked through, add the tomatoes and sprinkle a few drops of water, cover and cook.
1. Add salt and turmeric powder and continue to cook the mixture until it turns mushy.
1. This will take about 5 minutes.
1. Once the onion - tomato mixture has come together, push it aside in the pan, and add the methi leaves into the pan.
1. Mix gently allowing it to cook through as the leaves will wilt down.
1. As the methi leaves wilt down mix it along with the onion tomato base, and add in the dry spice powders - garam masala, cumin powder and coriander powder.
