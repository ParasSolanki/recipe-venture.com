### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mexican Vegetarian Burrito Bowl, you need to prepare the various components first.
1. For the coriander-lime rice, to the cooked rice, add the chopped coriander, lime juice, black pepper and salt.
1. Toss the mix together till all the flavors are well combined.
1. For the spicy beans, place a pan on heat, add some oil to it and allow it to get warm.
1. Add the onion, garlic and sauté it for 1-2 minutes until the onions are softened.
1. Then add tomato puree and cook for 5-10 minutes on a medium heat.
1. When the mix begins to bubble, add the cooked kidney beans/rajma along with the water that was used for cooking it.
1. Stir well.
1. Add Chipotle chilli along with Adobo sauce, crushed cumin and salt.
1. If using red chilli flakes instead, add it now.
1. Mix it all up well and cook to make a thick sauce.
1. This may take 5-7 minutes.
1. Turn off the heat and keep it aside.
1. For the sautéed peppers/vegetables, place a pan on heat, add some oil to it and allow it to get warm.
1. Once done add all the chopped peppers (or any other vegetables that you may like) along with the garlic.
1. Sprinkle salt and sauté for 1-2 minutes.
1. Then, add chilli flakes and oregano, toss together and turn off the heat.
1. Keep aside till ready to use.
1. For the roasted corn salsa, char the corn on the stove top or in a preheated oven.
1. Take the kernels off the cob and put it in a bowl.
1. Add in the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly.
1. Keep aside until later use.
1. For the guacamole, prepare the Avocado guacamole but remember that guacamole needs to be eaten fresh, so this is one component that has to be made last, or just before assembling and serving the burrito bowl.
1. To assemble the burrito bowl, if you are preparing one big bowl for your guests, use a fairly deep 8-9” flat bottom bowl or serving dish.
1. A burrito bowl is essentially layered, so begin with the coriander-lime rice.
1. Spread it generously at the base of the bowl.
1. Over it, spoon the spicy beans and spread it around the rice.
1. Next, layer the sauteed peppers over the beans.
1. On top of that goes a layer of guacamole.
1. Spread some corn salsa over it, and top it with the lettuce (if using), cheese and black olives and serve.
1. If you are making individual burrito bowls for a smaller crowd, follow the same sequence of layers, but use smaller sized ramekins for serving.
1. To make a Burrito Bar, simply place all the prepared components on convenient location.
1. Give your guests individual bowls and allow them to choose their favorite toppings to assemble the bowls of their choice.
1. To serve it as a warm winter casserole, once assembled, bake the bowl in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes and serve hot with baked Tortilla chips.
1. Serve the Mexican Vegetarian Burrito Bowl for a wholesome dinner followed by a dessert of Apple Enchiladas.
