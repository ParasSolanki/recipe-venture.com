1. Transfer the batter to a bowl.
1. Add about 1 teaspoon of salt to the batter and blend the batter with your hands for about 10 minutes.

1. If your batter turns too runny or if you do not whisk the batter with your hands the gujiyas will not turn soft.

1. Sprinkle some roasted cumin powder, crushed peppercorns and grated ginger (if you are using).
1. Fold the circle into half holding onto the plastic sheet.
1. Carefully pull the plastic sheet making sure the shaped gujiyas donâ€™t break.
1. Place the gujiyas on your wet palm and now pull off the plastic sheet from the other side of the gujiyas.
1. Carefully drop the gujiyas in hot oil and deep fry until golden brown on both sides.
1. Make sure the flame is on medium low.
1. Into a wide bowl, add 1-litre water, Enos fruit salt/cooking soda and sugar.
1. Mix everything well and keep it aside.
1. Once the gujiyas turn golden brown, transfer the gujiyas into the water bowl.
1. Repeat for rest of the batter.
1. Let the fried gujiyas soak in water for good 1 to 2 hours.
1. After 1-2 hours, remove the soaked gujiyas from water, keep it between your palm and gently press it to squeeze out the water.
1. Place the gujiyas on serving plates.
