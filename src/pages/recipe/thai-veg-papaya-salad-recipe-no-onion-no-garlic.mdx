### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Roasted Peanuts (Moongphali) - or roasted cashew.
- 2 tablespoon Brown Sugar (Demerara Sugar).
- 3 tablespoon Lemon juice.
- 1 cup Tomato - sliced.
- 1/4 cup Basil leaves.
- 1 Green Chilli - sliced.
- 2 tablespoon Soy sauce.
- 5 Green beans (French Beans).

### Instructions

1. To prepare Veg Thai Papaya Salad (Without Pounding, No Onion No Garlic), shred the papaya using the largest grater or a sharp large knife (Thailand method) and run it under the surface continually to release nice and thin shreds.
1. In a food processor or chopper, add the chili, soya sauce, oil, lime juice and brown sugar.
1. Churn until liquid oozes from the chilli.
1. Slice the beans into segments and add them to the chopper or processor.
1. Pulse to lightly chop and bruise the beans (in Thailand the beans are pounded to bruise them, but this method works just as well).
1. Place the shredded papaya, and other vegetables-tomatoes, bell peppers that you are using- in a large salad bowl, holding back some of the basil for the garnish.
1. Pour over the dressing and beans and toss.
1. Finally, add the nuts and toss again.
1. Adjust spices and taste as per requirement.
1. Serve Veg Thai Papaya Salad (No Onion No Garlic) as it is or as a side dish to any Thai entree.
1. If this is your main course, try serving like they do in Thailand, with a side of jasmine sticky rice.
