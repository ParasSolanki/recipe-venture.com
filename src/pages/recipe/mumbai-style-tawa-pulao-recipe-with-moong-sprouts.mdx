### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mumbai Style Tawa Pulao Recipe with Moong Sprouts, make sure you have some cooked rice ready and the remaining ingredients prepared accordingly.
1. Note: Brown rice takes a little while to cook, so it is important to soak the rice for about 30 minutes before you cook them in a saucepan or a pressure cooker.
1. Heat olive oil in a pan; add the onions, ginger, garlic and bell peppers.
1. Stir-fry on medium heat until the onions and bell peppers are lightly softened.
1. Once the onions and peppers are lightly softened, add the remaining ingredients, except the rice and give it a good stir.
1. Finally add the cooked rice and gently stir to combine the vegetables and the spices well into the rice.
1. Once well combined, check the salt, spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer the Tawa Pulao for about 3 to 4 minutes so the rice absorbs all the spices well.
1. After a few minutes, turn off the heat, stir in the coriander leaves and the Tawa pulao is ready to be served.
1. To serve the Tawa Pulao, spoon the Mumbai Style Tawa Pulao Recipe with Moong Sprouts into a serving bowl, sprinkle some sev or bhujia and squeeze a dash of lemon and enjoy.
1. Serve Mumbai Style Tawa Pulao Recipe with Moong Sprouts along with Tomato Onion Tadka Raita, Boondi Raita or any other Raita of your choice.
