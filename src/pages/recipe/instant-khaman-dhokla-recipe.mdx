### Instructions

1. To begin preparing the Khaman Dhokla, prepare all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. Grease a 7 inch cake tin or a dhokla pan and keep aside.
1. Prepare a steamer with water and keep it ready.
1. First, make the green chilli ginger mixture.
1. Into a small jar of mixer grinder, add the green chillies, ginger and water and blend to make a puree.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Into a large mixing bowl, add all the ingredients along with the above green chilli ginger paste and keep aside.
1. Whisk well to combine, the addition of lemon juice and soda will make the Khaman Dhokla batter froth up.
1. It is important you steam the batter immediately once it is well combined, so that the Khaman Dhokla remains fluffy when steamed.
1. Pour the Khaman Dhokla batter into the greased pan and place it in the prepared steamer.
1. Cover the steamer and turn on the heat to high and steam for 10 minutes until done.
1. You will know when it is done, when you insert a knife in the centre and around the edges and it comes out clean.
1. Remove the Khaman Dhokla from the steamer and allow it to cool completely.
1. Do not cut it while it is warm or hot as it will crumble.
1. The next step is to prepare the tadka along with the sugar lemon water.
1. Preheat a pan with oil over medium heat; add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Once it crackles, add the green chillies and curry leaves and stir for about a minute.
1. Once done, add the water, lemon juice, sugar and salt.
1. Stir well until the sugar has dissolved and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the tadka to cool a bit.
1. Once the Khaman Dhokla has cooled completely, cut it into squares or diamonds.
1. Spoon the tadka over the Khaman Dhokla so it gets soaked well.
1. If there is more tadka water remaining, just keep it aside and pour it later when you feel it has become dry or you want it more juicy.
1. Remove the Khaman Dhokla from the pan and place it on a serving platter.
1. Sprinkle freshly grated coconut and chopped coriander leaves and serve.
1. Serve it along with Green Chutney and Adrak Chai as an evening snack.
