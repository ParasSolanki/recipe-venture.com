### Ingredients

- 1 pinch Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 2 tablespoons Fresh coconut - pieces.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli flakes - adjust as per spice tolerance.
- 10 Shallots - or 1 large onion.
- 250 grams Chinese Potato - cut into medium size pieces.
- Salt - as per taste.
- 3 cloves Garlic - finely chopped.
- 1 sprig Curry leaves.
- Coconut Oil - enough to shallow fry.

### Instructions

1. Baked Chinese Potato Recipe also called Koorka Mezhukuperatti in Malayalam is an easy recipe.
1. Firstly, clean the koorka/ Chinese potatoes and cut them into medium sized pieces.
1. Pre-heat oven to 150 degree Celsius.
1. Meanwhile, pressure cook the Chinese potato/ koorka with turmeric powder, shallots/ onions, garlic, chili flakes, salt, curry leaves and coconut pieces (if using).
1. Since these koorkas should be firm yet cooked, switch off flame just before the whistle and let the pressure cooker cool by itself.
1. Grease a baking tray.
1. Spread the cooked koorka on the baking tray.
1. Drizzle a little coconut oil over the vegetable in the tray (or brush the oil to the potatoes with the help of a cooking brush).
1. Bake in the oven at 150 degree Celsius for 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned and crisp.
1. I don't like mine too crisp, so didn't keep in oven for too long.
1. But if you prefer it nice and crisp, bake for extra 4-5 minutes in the oven.
1. Serve hot with rice plain rice and Avial or a curry of your choice, to make a Kerala style dinner at home.
