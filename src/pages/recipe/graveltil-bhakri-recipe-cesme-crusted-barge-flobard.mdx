### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 3 cups Bajra Flour ( Pearl Millet).
- Lukewarm Water - as required.
- 1/4 cup Sesame seeds (Til seeds).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Bajri-Til Bhakri, first sift the bajra flour and salt together in a deep mixing bowl.
1. Knead the dough well with 1/4 cup of lukewarm water at a time, until it comes together in a smooth ball.
1. The dough will be similar to what we prepare for Makke Ki Roti.
1. Grease the dough with ghee, cover with a muslin cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.
1. Meanwhile heat tawa over medium heat.
1. Dust your rolling surface with little whole wheat flour.
1. Divide the dough into 6 - 8 equal portions and roll out a portion of the dough into a round and thick roti using your hands.
1. You can shape the roti by pressing out a circle with your fingers as well.
1. Place the roti over the pre-heated skillet and spread a little water on the surface of the bhakri.
1. Now sprinkle some sesame seeds on the surface and press lightly with a flat spatula, so that the seeds stick to the upper part of the roti.
1. Turn over the roti and cook the other side for a few more seconds.
1. Lift the roti tongs and roast over the direct flame till brown spots appear on both the sides.
1. Similarly, prepare the remaining Bajri-til Bhakri and serve it with a dollop of ghee and Bhogichi Bhaji.
