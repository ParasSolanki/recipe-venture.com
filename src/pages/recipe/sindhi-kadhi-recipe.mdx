### Instructions

1. To begin making the Sindhi Kadhi Recipe, first wash and soak the toor dal for 1/2 an hour.
1. Then put it in a pressure cooker along with tomatoes with enough water to completely submerge the dal.
1. Close the lid of the pressure cooker and keep the whistle on.
1. Pressure cook the dal until done, About 4 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release from the cooker naturally, then open the lid and mash the dal into a smooth mix using a potato masher or hand blender into a smooth purée.
1. Place a deep pan on the heat, add 1 tablespoon oil and warm it.
1. Then, add the slit okras and saute them on a medium flame until they are cooked through and lose the slime that okra tends to have.
1. After about 6-7 minutes they will begin to crisp up.
1. Transfer these okra onto a plate and set aside to be used later.
1. In the same pan heat the remaining oil and warm it.
1. Add mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, asafoetida, curry leaves and red chillies in quick succession and let them crackle and crisp up.
1. Once done add the besan next and saute lightly till the besan gets well coated with the oil, and browns evenly.
1. You will know when he besan is roasted when it loses it's raw aroma and starts smelling toasted.
1. To this gradually add a cup of water while continuously whisking, making sure that there are no lumps.
1. Once the besan mixture has mixed well with the water, add the puréed dal to it and mix well.
1. Allow it to simmer gently, while adding the tamarind paste, jaggery powder and mixing again.
1. Bring the Sindhi kadhi to a boil and allow it to simmer for a couple of minutes.
1. Lastly, add the cooked okra and simmer for another 5 minutes till the Sindhi kadhi reaches a silky, thick gravy consistency and all the flavours combine well.
1. Serve Sindhi Kadhi Recipe with Steamed Rice and Sindhi Tuk Patata for a lovely meal.
