### Instructions

1. To begin making the Spicy Grilled Lime & Mango Chicken Recipe we will first make the marinade.
1. To make the marinade in a mixer jar combine, the ripe mango with sriracha sauce, fish sauce, lemon juice, olive oil and garlic.
1. Grind this into a smooth paste and set aside.
1. You will have approximately 1 cup of the marinade mixture.
1. You can add additional ripe mangoes if you would like more sauce.
1. Wash the chicken breasts thoroughly and make diagonal slits on the surface of the breasts.
1. In a mixing bowl, place the chicken breasts and pour this marinade over it.
1. Marinade for about an hour.
1.  Cover the chicken and keep it aside, while it is marinating.
1. Heat a grill pan on medium heat and brush some oil on it.
1. Ensure the pan is well heated.
1. Once the chicken has been marinated for an hour, place it on the hot grill pan and cook it for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until well done, ensuring the chicken has cooked through nicely.
1. Ensure not to over cook as the chicken then becomes hard and rubbery.
1. Once it is well cooked, remove it from the pan and allow it to rest on a plate.
1. Transfer the remaining marinade into a saucepan, add in some more sriracha sauce, some honey and bring it to a single boil.
1. Next in a small bowl make a slurry of the corn flour along with the water and add it to the saucepan which has the mango mixture and bring it to a boil and allow the sauce to thicken.
1. Turn off the heat.
1. Observe the sauce has thickened and has a nice sheen on it.
1. This will be the sauce for our Spicy Grilled Lime & Mango Chicken Recipe.
1. Once done, spoon the Mango Sauce on a platter and place a portion of the grilled chicken and serve hot.
1. Serve Spicy Grilled Lime & Mango Chicken as an appetizer with some lemon wedges along with the sauce.
1. Or you could also serve it as a main along with Buttered Herbed Rice Recipe or Garlic Bread With Herb Butter Recipe and some Roasted Mushroom Recipe for a steak style meal.
1. Finish of with a dessert of Greek Yogurt Chocolate Mousse Recipe.
