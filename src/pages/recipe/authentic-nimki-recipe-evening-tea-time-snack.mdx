### Ingredients

- 2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- Sunflower Oil - for deep frying.
- 1/4 cup Ghee - or oil.
- 1 teaspoon Ajwain (Carom seeds).
- 2 tablespoons Chaat Masala Powder.
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.
- 1 teaspoon Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Nimki (Mathri) recipe, we will first make the dough for the Nimki.
1. In a large mixing bowl, add all purpose flour, oil or ghee, salt and ajwain.
1. Combine the flour well into the ghee until you get a crumbly mixture.
1. Add little water at a time and knead to make a very stiff nimki dough.
1. Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 minutes.
1. After 30 minutes of resting, divide the dough into 20 equal balls.
1. Roll each ball into a 4 inch disc.
1. Apply little ghee on the disc and sprinkle some chaat masala.
1. Fold the disc to make a semi circle, apply little ghee on the semicircle and fold once again to make a triangle.
1. Prick the Nimki (Mathri) with a fork on both sides, so they that they donâ€™t open and fluff up while deep frying them.
1. Make the remaining portions of the mathri in the same manner.
1. Heat oil for deep frying.
1. When the oil is slightly hot, add a few Nimki (Mathri) at a time and fry on low heat until golden brown and crisp.
1. Do make sure to fry on low to medium heat, else the Nimki will feel raw from the inside and crisp from the outside.
1. Keep turning the Nimki (Mathri) while frying.
1. Once done, drain the excess oil and place them on paper towels and allow them to cool.
1. Once cooled, store the Nimki (Mathri) in an airtight container for up to a month.
1. Serve the Parti Mathri or Nimki with ginger tea or mango pickle as a tea time snack or make it for the festival like Diwali, Holi or any other special occasion.
