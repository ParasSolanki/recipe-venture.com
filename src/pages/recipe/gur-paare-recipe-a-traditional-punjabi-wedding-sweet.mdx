### Ingredients

- 500 grams All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1/4 cup Ghee.
- 250 grams Jaggery.
- Sunflower Oil - for deep frying.
- 1 teaspoon Fennel seeds (Saunf).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Gur Paare Recipe in a large mixing bowl add the maida and the melted ghee.
1. Keep mixing the flour and ghee mixture until you get coarse crumb like texture and the ghee starts to hold the flour together.
1. At this point add teaspoons of water at a time and knead it to make a firm dough.
1. Divide the dough in four parts and roll each portion of the dough into a half an inch thick round circle.
1. Cut them into vertical strips and then into 2-3 inch long strips.
1. Repeat for rest of the dough portions.
1. In a kadai, heat oil for deep frying on medium heat.
1.  Once the oil is hot, add the cut dough strips and fry until slightly brown and crisp.
1. Do make sure to fry on medium heat so it gets crisp evenly.
1. Drain them on a kitchen towel and allow them to cool a bit.
1. In another heavy bottomed pan, add chopped or grated jaggery.
1. On a slow flame allow it to melt, stirring continuously all the time.
1. Cook till you attain the consistency where you add a drop of jaggery into the cool water and it solidifies.
1. At this point add the saunf and stir.
1. Turn off the heat and immediately add the fried strips to the jaggery syrup.
1. Mix quickly using two ladles so that all the strips are evenly coated with the jaggery.
1. Once done, the Gur Paare is ready.
1. Transfer the Gur Paare onto a tray cool completely.
1. Once completely cool separate the strips carefully taking care not to break them too much.
1. Store them an airtight container for 15 days.
1. Serve the Gur Paare for festivals like Karva Chauth or any other special occasion in the family.
