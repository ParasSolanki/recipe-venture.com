### Instructions

1. To begin making Thecha Paniyaram Recipe we will first make the thecha.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a small tadka pan, add the garlic, green chillies and saute till the garlic cloves turn golden in colour.
1. Once done turn off the heat and add the coriander leaves to the pan.
1. Let the coriander leaves wilt with the heat of the pan.
1. Now, pound the roasted garlic, green chillies and coriander leaves along with almonds to a coarse mix using a mortar and pestle.
1. Keep aside.
1. Take a big bowl, add the sour dosa batter, semolina, salt to taste and enough water.
1. Mix well to combine to make a thick flowing batter.
1. Add in the almond thecha that we prepared earlier and mix well.
1. Now heat the paniyaram pan on medium heat, brush each cavity with oil and pour a little batter in each cavity of the paniyaram mould.
1. Add a few drops of oil on the sides of each paniyaram and let the Thecha Paniyaram turn golden brown on its surface.
1. This will take around 5 minutes.
1. Flip the Thecha Paniyaram over and let the other side also cook for another 5 minutes till golden brown on both sides.
1. Once done transfer the Thecha Paniyaram into a serving plate and serve hot.
1. Serve the Thecha Paniyaram Recipe for breakfast or as a tea time snack with coconut chutney and  South Indian Filter Coffee.
