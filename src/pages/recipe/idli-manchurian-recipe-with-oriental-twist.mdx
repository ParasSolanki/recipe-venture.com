### Instructions

1. To prepare Idli Manchurian Recipe With Oriental Twist, get all the ingredients ready along with leftover idlis.
1. Or make idlis from idli batter in idli steamer and keep aside for 1-2 hours or more.
1. Cut each idli into 6-7 pieces.
1. Heat a shallow fry pan and add a teaspoon of oil and spread evenly.
1. Place 6-8 pieces of idli at the bottom of the pan and shallow fry for a few minutes until crisp.
1. The idli pieces will turn brown and crunchy at the base.
1. This is one way of making crunchy idli pieces.
1. I prefer making the crispy idli pieces this way.
1. The other way (easier way) is shallow fry whole idlis until they turn light brown.
1. Then cut these idlis into 6-7 pieces.
1. Now, heat another pan, with a wide base.
1. Add the remaining oil.
1.  Once the oil is heated, add chopped onions and fry until it turns crispy.
1. Add the chopped capsicum pieces and fry well.
1. Add the ginger paste and mix well.
1.  Add to the above mix, add soy sauce, red chilli powder and salt.
1.  Add slit green chillies and saute well.
1. Put off the heat and sprinkle oregano flakes and mix.
1. Garnish Idli Manchurian Recipe With Oriental Twist with coriander leaves and chopped spring onion leaves and serve with roasted tomato sauce or Schezuan Sauce as an evening snack.
