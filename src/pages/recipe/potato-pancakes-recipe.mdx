### Instructions

1. Let this onion potato mixture sit for about 10 minutes.
1. Drain the potatoes and squeeze out the excess liquid.
1. Place the squeezed potatoes in a muslin cloth or on a metal sieve.
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the potato mixture, minced garlic, egg (or yogurt), flour, bread crumbs, parsley and chives.
1. Season with salt and pepper.
1. Combine the ingredients to form a thick paste like mixture.
1. Fill the frying pan an inch deep with oil.
1. Heat the oil over medium heat.
1. Take a small portion from the potato mixture and shape it into flat patties of medium thickness.
1. Shallow fry the pancakes from both the sides until crisp and golden.
1. This might take about 5 to 7 minutes each side.
1. Drain on paper towels and similarly prepare remaining pancakes.
1. Serve Potato Pancakes hot along with Spicy Mexican Salsa for a delicious weekend breakfast or as a tea time snack along with masala chai.
