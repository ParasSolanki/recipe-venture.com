### Ingredients

- 300 grams Colocasia root (Arbi).
- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1 Green Bell Pepper (Capsicum) - diced.
- Sunflower Oil - for cooking.
- 1 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- 1 inch Ginger - grated.
- 1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- Salt - according to taste.
- 1 Tomato - chopped.
- 1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Arbi Shimla Mirch Sabzi Recipe, first we will cook the arbi in a pressure cooker.
1. Into the pressure cooker, add arbi and 1/2 cup water and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1.  Once the pressure has released, peel and dice the arbi and keep aside.
1. Allow it to cool completely and firm up.
1. The next step in making the Arbi Shimla Mirch Sabzi Recipe, heat about a tablespoon of oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add the ginger and capsicum.
1. Saute for a few minutes until the capsicum is tender and begin to start changing color.
1. The capsicum would be lightly browned around the edges and softened too.
1. Once the capsicum has softened, add in tomatoes and sprinkle some salt and keep sauteing until the tomatoes become mushy.
1. At this point, stir in the boiled arbi, turmeric powder, coriander powder and garam masala powder, red chilli powder and salt.
1. Stir the Arbi Shimla Mirch Sabzi along with the spices until well coated.
1. Check the salt and adjust accordingly.
1. Cover the pan; turn the heat to low and simmer the Arbi Shimla Mirch Sabzi Recipe for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Once done, turn off the heat, stir in the freshly chopped coriander leaves and transfer the Arbi Shimla Mirch Sabzi to a serving platter and serve hot.
1. Serve Arbi Shimla Mirch Sabzi Recipe with Punjabi Dal Tadka, Missi Roti, Beetroot, Carrot & Cucumber Salad with Peanuts and Rice for a delicious weekday lunch or dinner with your family.
