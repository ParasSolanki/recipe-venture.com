### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Milk - to knead the dough.
- 1/2 cup Sugar - powdered.
- 1/2 cup Ragi Flour (Finger Millet/ Nagli).
- 1 teaspoon Baking powder.
- 1/2 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/2 cup Butter - cold.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Eggless Ragi & Whole Wheat Crisp Biscuits recipe, firstly roast the ragi flour in a cast iron pan on a medium low flame.
1. Keep tossing for a few minutes until the aroma of roasted flour fills the air.
1. In a mixing bowl, add sifted whole wheat flour and the roasted ragi flour.
1. Also add sifted baking powder to the flour and give it a gentle mix.
1. Refrigerate butter for 20 minutes and cut it into cubes.
1. Add these butter cubes to the flour mix.
1. Mix the flour with the butter with your finger tips till you get a coarse mixture.
1. Add powdered sugar and mix.
1. Add milk 1 tablespoon at a time and bring the mixture together like a dough.
1. If you add too much liquid or too less liquid it will not hold the shape and will crumble.
1. Cover it with a cling wrap and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes.
1. Roll the dough on a flat counter using a roller pin.
1. You may dust a little with wheat flour to prevent it from sticking.
1. The rolled dough should not be very thin nor very thick, just right.
1. Cut it into desired shapes.
1. I am using a circular biscuit cutter, you can use cookie cutters or even lids.
1. Place the biscuits on a greased baking sheet.
1. You can use a sharp knife or spatula to lift it up.
1. You can line the baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. I am using a silicon mat to prevent sticking to the bottom.
1. You can make striped design with a fork and bake it in a preheated oven on 180 degree C for 15 to 18 minutes in the middle rack until they acquire a slight brown colour.
1. The biscuits will still me soft as you remove them from the oven.
1. Let the cool down on a wire rack until they become crisp and delicious!Serve Eggless Ragi & Whole Wheat Crisp Biscuits with a cup of Masala Chai and Paneer Tikka Wraps for a tea break with your friends and family.
