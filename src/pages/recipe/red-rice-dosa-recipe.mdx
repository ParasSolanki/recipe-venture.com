excerpt: "Soak the red rice in water such that the all the red rice is completely immersed in water"

### Ingredients

- Water - as required.
- Salt - to taste.
- Sunflower Oil - for cooking the dosa.
- 1 cup Red matta rice.
- 1/2 cup White Urad Dal (Split).
- 1 teaspoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).

### Instructions

1. Soak the red rice in water such that the all the red rice is completely immersed in water.
1. The level of water is an inch above the red rice in the bowl.
1. Let it soak for about 6 hours.
1. Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water.
1. The level of water will be 2 inches above the dal in the bowl.
1. Let it soak for about 6 hours.
1. First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter.
1. While grinding just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter.
1. The batter will look fluffy.
1. Grind the red rice into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter.
1. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery.
1. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .
1. The red rice batter is a just slightly coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.
1. Combine the urad and red rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments.
1. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.
1. Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.
1. Note on fermenting the Red Rice Idli & Dosa BatterFermentation has to take place where the weather is warm.
1. So ideally in summer, the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity.
1. But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven.
1. If your oven has light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven.
1. Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment.
1. If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment.
1. This process can be mastered with experience.
1. Method For making Dosa'sThe freshly fermented batter is great for making idlis.
1. So typically and traditionally, the first day after the rise, we made idlis at home and there after it is great for making dosas as well.
1. For making ragi idlis do not dilute the batter with water.
1. When making Red Rice dosas you can optionally dilute the batter with a little water to help in easy spreading.
1. Preheat the skillet on medium heat and grease it.
1. Pour a ladleful of batter on the preheated tawa and spread the batter in circular motion to make a thin dosa.
1. Drizzle ghee or oil around the dosa and allow it to crisp.
1. Once done, flip the dosa and cook on the other side for a few seconds and serve.
1. Proceed the same way to make the Red Rice Dosa with the remaining batter.
1. Serve the Red Rice Dosa along with a bowl of Drumstick Sambar and Tomato Onion Chutney along with a glass of vegetable juice like Beetroot and Celery Juice for breakfast.
