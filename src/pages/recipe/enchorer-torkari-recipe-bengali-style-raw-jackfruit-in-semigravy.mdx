### Instructions

1. To begin making the Enchorer Torkari recipe, let us first cut the raw jackfruit.
1. In order to do that we have to first, grease our hands and the knife that we are going to use, with some oil.
1. This important tip ensures that the hands don't get sticky from the natural fruit latex/sap present in the fruit does not get onto your hands and makes the cutting process hassle-free.
1. Keep a bowl of water mixed with some salt, ready to put the cut raw jackfruit pieces to avoid discolouration of the fruit.
1. Now that your hands and knife are well greased, cut the the jackfruit in half, discard the skin and start making 1 inch pieces and soak them in the salted water.
1. Place the jackfruit in a pressure cooker with 1/4 cup of water and pressure cook for 2 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Drain any water from the jackfruit and set aside.
1. Heat mustard oil in a pan, on medium heat, when the oil is smoking hot, reduce the heat and pan fry the potato cubes till golden brown.
1. This will take about 5-7 minutes.
1. Take out the potato pieces with a slotted spoon.
1. Drain it and place on an absorbent paper.
1. Similarly, pan fry the jackfruit pieces.
1. Heat mustard oil in the same pan, on medium heat, when the oil is hot, increase the heat and pan fry the jackfruit pieces till golden brown.
1. This will take about 2-3 minutes.
1. Take out the jackfruit pieces with a slotted spoon.
1. Drain it and place on an absorbent paper.
1. In the same oil once again, add bay leaves, cinnamon stick, cardamom, cloves.
1. Once they begin to sizzle, add the minced garlic, cook over medium heat for 1 min or till the garlic starts to change colour.
1. Now add a teaspoon of sugar, mix well.
1. Next add onion, cover and cook for 3-4 minutes.
1. Uncover and cook till the onions take a nice red-brown colour.
1. At this stage add the ginger paste.
1. Cook for 1-2 minutes or till the raw smell of ginger is gone.
1. Add chopped tomatoes.
1. Sprinkle little salt, cover and cook till the tomatoes are mushy.
1. At this stage add in the cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, green chilies, sprinkle some water and  mix well.
1. As the masala starts to release oil, add the fried potato and jackfruit, mix well.
1. Add 1/4 cup of hot water to cover the vegetables, let the water boil, add salt, cover and cook till the vegetables are done.
1. This dish will have a thick gravy just about coating the vegetables.
1. Finally add ghee and garam masala powder, mix well.
1. Switch off heat, cover the pan and let it rest for sometime and serve hot.
1. Serve Enchorer Torkari along with Bengali Style Lau Die Tetor Dal and Bengali Luchi for a weekday meal.
