### Instructions

1. We begin making the Rajgira Paneer Paratha Recipe (Navratri Fasting/Vrat Recipe) by Mixing all the ingredients together in a mixing bowl with enough water to a dough consistency.
1. The rajgira flour is little hard to work with since it does not contain gluten so make sure to have enough flour to dust while rolling the dough.
1. Divide the dough into equal portions and roll it onto a board.
1. Heat a Flat bottomed pan and add the rolled paratha with some ghee and cook it on both the sides for about 2 minutes.
1. Serve your crispy Rajgira Paneer Paratha with No Onion No Garlic Tomato Chutney making it a delicious meal.
