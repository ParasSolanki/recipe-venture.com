### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- 500 grams Spinach Leaves (Palak) - finely chopped.
- 1 cup Cheddar cheese.
- Salt and Pepper - to taste.
- 1 All Purpose Pie Crust - dough made and chilled for a few hours.
- 1/4 cup Britannia Cream Cheese.
- 3 cloves Garlic - finely chopped.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Cheese and Spinach Tart Recipe, preheat the oven to 180 C and grease the muffin molds with butter.
1. Once the pie crust is chilled enough, to begin we will generously flour the work surface.
1. Place the chilled pie crust on the flour and using the heel of your palms, press down the dough to make it flat and pulling it outward to stretch the dough.
1. Now using a rolling pin roll out the dough to a large round of about quarter inch thickness.
1. Once done, cut the pie dough into pieces that will fit into your muffin mold.
1. Do your best to work quickly, keeping the dough as cold as possible and using enough flour that it doesnâ€™t stick to the counter.
1. Place and lightly press each of the dough pieces into a muffin tin.
1. Once all the pie dough pieces have fit in, place this in the refrigerator to chill until we get the spinach filling ready.
1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan or a wok, on medium heat; add in the chopped garlic and saute until it begins to sizzle.
1. Add in the chopped spinach, a dash of salt and a dash of black pepper powder.
1. Turn the heat to high and cook until the spinach is soft and all the water vapourised.
1. Once cooked and the water has vapourised allow the spinach to cool.
1. In a large bowl, to the cooled spinach add in a quarter cup of cream cheese and a cup grated cheese.
1. Stir to combine to form a smooth mixture.
1. If you like to spice it up like I do, add in some chilly flakes and stir it into the spinach.
1. Once the spinach is ready and the tart cups are chilled, spoon the spinach filling into each of the chilled tart cups.
1. Place the tart cups into the preheated oven and bake for about 20 minutes until the crust is golden brown.
1. Place the Cheese and Spinach Tarts on a party platter and serve them for holiday parties.
