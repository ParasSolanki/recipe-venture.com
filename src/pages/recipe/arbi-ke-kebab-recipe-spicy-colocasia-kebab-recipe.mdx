### Instructions

1. To begin making the Arbi ke Kebab Recipe, make sure you have all the ingredients handy.
1. We will be processing the ingredients for the kebab step by step.
1. It's ideal when you use a Food Processor, as it speeds up the process of making the kebabs.
1. To begin, add the coriander leaves, almonds, green chilli, ginger and garlic into the food processor and blend until you get a coarse mixture.
1. Transfer the contents in to a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the cooked and mashed Arbi and the remaining ingredients except the oil and breadcrumbs.
1. Combine all the ingredients well.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. The next step is the shape the Arbi Kebabs.
1. Since the Arbi is a very starchy vegetable, it will tend to stick to your fingers when you shape.
1. To prevent this, have a small bowl with a tablespoon of oil.
1. Grease your palms and fingers with the oil and shape the kebab dough into circular discs.
1. Once you shape them, roll them over bread crumbs and arrange them on a platter so you can cook them.
1. To cook the Arbi Ke Kebabs, preheat a pan on medium-high heat and grease the pan well.
1. Place the shaped kebas, drizzle oil over them and pan fry them until crisp and brown on both sides.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining Arbi Kebabs and serve them immediately along with Green Chutney.
