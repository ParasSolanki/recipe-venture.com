### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rajasthani Kanji Vada Recipe, we will first make the Kanji.
1. The kanji once made has to be fermented for at least 24 hours.
1. Combine all the ingredients for the Kanji in the small jar of the blender to make a smooth powder.
1. Transfer the powder to a large bowl that has a lid.
1. Add 1-1/2 liters of water to the powder and stir well to combine.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Cover the Kanji water with a lid and refrigerate for 24 hours.
1. Once you are ready to make the Kanji Vada's we will prepare to make the vada for this recipe.
1. Make sure you have soaked the dal for atleast two hours.
1. Drain the water.
1. Add the soaked dal, the moon sprouts, ginger and green chiles into a food processor and grind to a smooth thick batter without adding any water.
1. Next step is to pan fry the Vada.
1. Heat a Kuzhi Paniyaram Pan on medium heat.
1. Add a few drops of oil into each cavity.
1. Spoon a portion of the vada and add it into the cavity.
1. Cook the vadas evenly on both sides until golden brown on both sides and it is cooked from the inside.
1. You can optionally cover the pan and cook the vadas.
1. Proceed the same way with all the remaining vada batter.
1. Heat a large bowl with water and warm it slightly.
1. Once warm, turn off the heat.
1. Soak the pan fried vadas in the water for about 1/2 an hour.
1. This will soften the vadas as soon as they are fried.
1. Very similar to the dahi vada.
1. Drain off the excess water from the vada and place it in a large serving bowl.
1. Pour the fermented Kanji water into the vadas and refrigerate for a couple of more hours until the vadas get soaked well in the spicy kanji water and serve.
1. Serve the Rajasthani Kanji Vada Recipe as a tea time snack or as a side dish for parties.
