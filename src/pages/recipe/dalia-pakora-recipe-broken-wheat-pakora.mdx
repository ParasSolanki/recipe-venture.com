### Instructions

1. To begin making the Dalia Pakora Recipe, we will first cook the daliya.
1. Wash the daliya and set aside.
1. Heat a pressure cooker with 2 cups of water, add some salt to taste, cooking oil and the washed broken wheat.
1. Close the pressure cooker and pressure cook for 4-5 whistles.
1. Turn off the flame and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure has released, open the pressure cooker to check if the broken wheat has cooked through and there is no water remaining.
1. If there is any water, place it on heat and keep stirring until it most of the water is evaporated.
1. Transfer the cooked broken wheat into the mixing bowl.
1. Set aside and allow it to cool.
1. Once the broken wheat has cooled, into the mixing bowl add, the besan, onion, coriander leaves, green chilli, salt, turmeric powder, cumin seeds, ajwain, cooking oil and water, as required to make a thick dalia pakora batter.
1. We need a thick batter, use just enough water to combine all the ingredients of the Dalia Pakora batter.
1. Heat a paniyaram pan on medium flame, drop a few drops of cooking oil in each of the cavities, once the pan and the oil is hot, quickly add in the eno fruit salt into the dalia pakora batter and give it a good mix.
1. Drop tablespoons full of the dalia pakora batter into each cavity and cook on medium-high heat, for a couple of minutes on each side.
1. Making sure the inside of the dalia pakora is well cooked and the outer covering is nice and crisp.
1. Drain the well fried dalia pakoras on an absorbent paper and serve hot.
1. Alternatively, you could also deep fry the dalia pakoras in a kadai.
1. Serve Dalia Pakora as a tea time snack along with Green Chutney, Date Tamarind Chutney and a steaming hot cuppa Adrak Chai.
