1. We are going to make this sabzi in a single pot in the electric pressure cooker.
1. Turn the electric pressure cooker on and change the mode to Saute Mode and allow the pressure cooker to preheat for 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Once the pan is preheated, add the oil, cumin seeds, asafoetida, red chillies and allow them to crackle.
1. Add the garlic and onions and saute until the onions soften.
1. Now that the onions are soft, add the dry masalas - red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder and salt.
1. Mix well.
1. Once the raw smell of maslas go away, add the pickle, jaggery and give it a good stir.
1. At this stage, add the potatoes and saute until everything is mixed well.
1. Sprinkle a tablespoon of water into the electric pressure cooker.
1. Cover the electric pressure cooker and change the mode to manual and set the cooking time to 25 minutes.
1. Allow the Achari Aloo Sabzi to cook until the electric pressure cooker gets into the keep warm mode.
1. Once done and the pressure has released, open the pressure cooker, stir in the coriander leaves and give it a stir.
