1. Then do it with wheat flour for brown bread and put on the white dough.
1. Seal the edges by pressing both the dough together.
1. Cover with plastic  wrap or aluminium  foil and set aside for 30 to 45 minutes.
1. Position an oven rack on the lowest setting and preheat the oven to 200 degree C.
1. Brush the loaves with some of the melted butter or beaten egg.
1. Bake the loaf for 30 to 35 minutes, until golden brown.
1. Remove from the oven and immediately brush with more of the melted butter.
