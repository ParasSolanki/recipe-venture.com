### Instructions

1. To prepare Linzer Cookies Recipe, sift together the flour, ground almonds and salt.
1. Keep aside.
1. Beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy (using an electric mixer or wooden spoon).
1. Add the milk and vanilla, beat until incorporated.
1. Add the flour mixture and beat at low speed until a dough forms.
1. Wrap in plastic and chill for atleast 30 minutes.
1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out chilled dough to about 1/4 inch thickness.
1. Using a cookie cutter, cut out shapes and place 1-1/2 inches apart on a parchment lined or greased cookie sheet.
1. Re-roll scraps and cut out cookies until all dough is used up.
1. Using a smaller cookie cutter, cut out the centres of half of the cookie dough shapes you have on your cookie sheet.
1. You can bake the cut out centres too, or roll them back to make more cookies similarly until all the dough is used up.
1. Chill your sheet for 30 minutes or freeze for 10 minutes.
1. This helps the cookies maintain shape.
1. Meanwhile preheat your oven to 180 C / 350 F.
1. Bake the cookies for 14-16 minutes, rotating the pans at around 8 minutes.
1. The cookies will only lightly brown around the edges.
1. Let cool on pan for 3-4 minutes and completely on a wire rack.
1. Once cool , spread a teaspoon or so of jam on the underside of the whole cookie and dust the top of the cookies with the centres cut out with icing sugar.
1. Sandwich them and enjoy Linzer Cookies Recipe during tea time.
