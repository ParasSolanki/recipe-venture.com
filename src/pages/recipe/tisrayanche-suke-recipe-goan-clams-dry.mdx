### Instructions

1. To begin making the Tisrayanche Suke recipe, first we will clean the clams.
1. First open them into halves using a sharp knife.
1. Then with a knife, lift all the flesh from one shell, and drop it in the other and discard the shell with no flesh.
1. Repeat for all the remaining clams.
1. Wash them well for 3 to 4 times.
1. Apply turmeric powder and keep it aside for 10 minutes.
1. In a heavy bottom vessel, add these clams, and cook on medium high heat, uncovered for 5 minutes, mixing in between.
1. If you feel the clams are too dry, then add a tablespoon of water.
1. Usually you donâ€™t require water for this.
1. Now add coconut, chopped onions, slit chillies, red chilli powder.
1. Mix well.
1. Serve Tisrayanche Suke along with Goan Fish Curry and Steamed Rice for a weekday meal with your friends and family.
