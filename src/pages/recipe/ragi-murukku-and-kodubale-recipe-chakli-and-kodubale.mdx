### Ingredients

- Sunflower Oil - for deep frying.
- 1 tablespoon Butter - melted.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 cup Urad Dal Flour.
- 3/4 cup Ragi Flour (Finger Millet/ Nagli).
- 3/4 cup Bajra Flour ( Pearl Millet).
- 1-1/2 cups Rice flour.

- 2 cups Lukewarm Water.
- 1 cup Gram flour (besan).
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).

### Instructions

1. To begin with the Ragi Murukku, dry roast the four flours until aromatic for about 4 to 6 minutes on medium heat.
1. Switch off the heat and cool it completely.
1. Mix all the powders, chili powder, salt and cumin together.
1. Pour a tablespoon of melted butter in the mixture and mix thoroughly.
1. Now add lukewarm water little by little and mix into a soft and pliable dough.
1. Roll them out into 3 or 4 sections and shape them into cylinders.
1. To make KadubalesMake small balls, roll them out on a greased paper or plastic sheet.
1. Once the balls are long cylindrical tubes, join them to make tiny bangles.
1. To make ChakliAdd the dough into the chakli maker.
1. Press them into tiny concentric circles, or strands, of any desired shape and size.
1. Heat oil in a deep fry pan on medium-high.
1. When the oil starts to smoke, add a tiny ball of dough; if it sizzles and rises to the oil surface, the oil is hot enough.
1. Reduce the heat to medium; gently lower the chaklis and kodubales into the oil.
1. They will sink, and foam at first, then come up to the surface quickly.
1. Flip them over to the other side and let cook to a golden brown.
1. Drain the savouries on a paper napkin or sieve over a bowl.
1. When they are completely cool, store them in airtight boxes in a cool dark place.
1. Serve Ragi snacks with a cup of hot masala chai to enjoy it.
