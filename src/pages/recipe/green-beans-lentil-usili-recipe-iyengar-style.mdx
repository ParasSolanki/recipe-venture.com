1. Place the filled steamer plates into the steamer and steam for 10 minutes on high heat.
1. Once steamed, turn off the heat and keep aside and allow it to cool.

1. Place a wok or kadai on medium heat and add a teaspoon of oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add mustard seeds and urad dal and allow it to crackle and the dal to turn golden brown.
1. After the seeds have crackled, add asafoetida, the curry leaves and the steamed paruppu usili and mix thoroughly.
1. Saute the dal in the oil for a good 3 to 4 minutes until it gets a perfect crumbly texture.
1. Once you have a good texture, stir in the green beans and turn off the heat.
1. Check the salt and adjust to taste accordingly.
