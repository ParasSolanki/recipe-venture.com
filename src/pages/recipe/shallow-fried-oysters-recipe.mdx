### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- 2 tablespoons Rice flour.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 20 Oysters - well-rinsed and drained in colander.
- 3 tablespoons Sunflower Oil - for shallow fry.
- 1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1/2 cup Sooji (Semolina/ Rava).
- 1 teaspoon Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin Shallow Fried Oysters Recipe, first, get all the oysters cleaned and keep them for draining out the excess water in a colander.
1. This step is important since the spices wonâ€™t get coated properly on to the oysters if they are watery.
1. You can also pat them dry with a paper towel to dry them.
1. Mix homemade garam masala, chili powder and haldi in a plate along with rava/ semolina and rice flour.
1. Heat a skillet/ pan, add a tablespoon of oil.
1. Coat each oyster well with the prepared masala mix and place on the skillet.
1. Cover it with a plate and cook on medium high heat for about 2-3 minutes.
1. Check in between.
1. If it looks dry, add a little oil and continue frying.
1. After 3 minutes, flip sides and cook uncovered for 2-3 more minutes.
1. Once these Pan-fried Oysters look fully cooked (dark browned on both the sides), switch off the stove.
1. Serve Shallow Fried Oysters Recipe hot with rice or mutton biriyani and fish curry.
