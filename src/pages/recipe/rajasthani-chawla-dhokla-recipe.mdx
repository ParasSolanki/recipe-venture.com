### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rajasthani Chawle Wale Dhokle recipe, Add the black eyed beans in 3 cups water in a pressure cooker.
1. Now add turmeric powder, coriander powder and the required salt.
1. Let it cook till the cooker releases 3 to 4 whistles.
1. Let it release the pressure normally.
1. Meanwhile we will make the dhoklas, add garlic, coriander and green chillies in mortal pestle and crush them together to make a coarse paste.
1. Next, add baking soda, half of the garlic, coriander and green chilli mixture, required salt and maize flour in a mixing bowl.
1. Open the pressure cooker and put the green chilli, garlic and coriander mixture in it and mix it with the black eyed beans.
1. Now, knead the dough properly with the required water and knead until the dough becomes really soft.
1. Make small Dhokla out of it just like we make the south indian wadas.
1. Put the cooker on gas again and add some water.
1. Once it comes to boil, add the uncooked dhokla in the boiling water.
1. Donâ€™t close the lid of the cooker.
1. Just cover it and let it cooker for 40 to 45 minutes on low flame.
1. Once it reaches the right consistency and the dhoklas are cooked switch off the gas.
1. To know if the dhoklas are cooker, insert a fort in the dhokla and if it comes out clean, it means your dhokla is cooked.
1. Once it is cooked, garnish it with coriander leaves and pour some hot ghee on it to serve.
1. Serve Rajasthani Chawle Wale Dhokle on its own with Kachumber Salad  for a wweknight dinner.
