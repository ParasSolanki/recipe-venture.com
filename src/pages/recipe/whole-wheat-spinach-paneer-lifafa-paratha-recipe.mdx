### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Wheat Spinach Paneer Lifafa Paratha Recipe, in a mixing bowl add the whole wheat flour, salt, 1 tablespoon melted ghee and mix.
1. Next add water little by little and start kneading the dough.
1. If you are looking for softer texture add only milk to knead the dough and no water.
1. Knead till you get soft, smooth dough.
1. Cover and let the paratha dough rest for 30 minutes.
1. While the lifafa paratha dough is resting we can make the stuffing.
1. Heat oil in a pan.
1. To hot oil add cumin seeds and wait till they turn slight brown.
1. Add onions and green chilies and sauté till onions turn soft.
1. Add finely chopped spinach and cook until spinach looses all it’s moisture.
1. Add salt to taste.
1. Once spinach is completely dry, turn off heat and keep it aside to cool down.
1. Add roasted cumin powder, chaat masala to grated paneer.
1. Add cooked spinach mix and mix them all together.
1. This paratha stuffing mixture should be dry.
1. If you find any liquid in it, squeeze it out.
1. Divide them into equal sized balls.
1. In a small bowl, combine the corn flour along with water to make a thick paste.
1. This will be used for sealing the edges.
1. Knead the paratha dough once more and divide them into equal sized balls (lemon sized).
1. Roll it thin about 10 inch.
1. Place it on hot griddle/tawa and cook for 10 seconds on each sides, without oil.
1. Dont over cook it.
1. Take it out of tawa.
1. Repeat this for rest of the dough.
1. Now place half cooked rotis on a flat surface.
1. Place a small portion of spinach paneer stuffing in the center.
1. Spread the stuffing all over leaving out the edges.
1. Apply corn flour paste on the edges of the roti.
1. Fold the 2 opposite corners of the roti over the stuffing.
1. Now fold the remaining 2 edges sealing the filling well.
1. This will look like a folded envelope.
1. Place the stuffed lifafa spinach paneer paratha over hot tawa, drizzle oil or ghee and cook on both sides until they turn brown on both sides.
1. Serve the Whole Wheat Spinach Paneer Lifafa Paratha immediately with some yogurt and pickle for breakfast or even a weeknight dinner.
