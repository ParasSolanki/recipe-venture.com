### Instructions

1. To begin making the Sukha Kala Chana Masala Recipe, ensure the kala chana is soaked overnight or for a minimum of 6-8 hours.

1. Heat a pan with ghee on medium flame, once the ghee is hot, add the cumin seeds and allow them to sizzle.
1. Next reduce the flame, add the ginger and green chillies.
1. Now add in all the dry spices - amchur powder, coriander powder, chaat masala,  and cumin powder.
1. Mix well and quickly add in the boiled kala chana.
1. Give it a good stir and simmer the sukha kala chana in the pan for 3 to 4 minutes until the masala gets well coated into the kala chana.
1. Once done, turn off the heat, check if you need to add more salt and adjust according to taste.
1. Transfer the Sukha Kala Chana into a serving bowl and serve as a prasad for the festivals like navratri.
1. Serve Sukha Kala Chana Masala Recipe along with Rava Kesari Bhath/ Sooji Halwa Recipe, and Puri Recipe as prasad for Ashtami or just as a Sunday brunch.
