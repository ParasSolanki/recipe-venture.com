### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Butter (unsalted).
- 1 Carrot (Gajjar) - washed and peeled.
- Cumin powder (Jeera) - a pinch.
- Salt - optionally a pinch.
- Black pepper powder - a pinch.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Buttered Carrot Fingers, dice the washed and peeled carrots into an inch wide and 4 inch long sticks.
1. Add these diced carrots to a pressure cooker along with a pinch of salt and with 2 tablespoons water.
1. Cover the pressure cooker and cook for one whistle.
1. After the first whistle, turn off the heat and remove the pressure immediately by running the pressure cooker under cold water.
1. This will prevent the carrots from getting overcooked.
1. Place a pan on low-medium flame, and add one teaspoon of unsalted butter.
1. Once the butter has melted, add the steamed carrots to the pan.
1. Saute for a couple of minutes until the butter has coated to the carrots.
1. Turn off the flame.
1. Sprinkle a small pinch of cumin powder or pepper powder on top of the carrots and optionally pinch of salt.
1. Serve these Buttered Carrot Fingers to your toddlers from 10 months onwards as finger foods/snack or even when travelling as they make for a perfect snack.
