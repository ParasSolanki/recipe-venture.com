### Instructions

1. To begin making the Cheesy Mushroom Masala Dosa Recipe, first make the ragi dosa batter and keep it handy.
1. *To make the Ragi Dosa Batter:Soak the rice, ragi and barley together in water such that the all the ingredients are completely immersed in water.
1. The level of water should be an inch above the rice in the bowl.
1. Let it soak for about 6 hours or overnight.
1. Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water.
1. The level of water should be 2 inches above the dal in the bowl.
1. Let it soak for about 6 hours.
1. After the soaking period, first grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter.
1. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very smooth batter.
1. The batter will look fluffy.
1. Grind the rice, ragi, barley into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into an almost smooth batter.
1. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery.
1. If required grind a little at a time to get a  smooth batter .
1. Combine the urad and rice ragi batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the ragi idli dosa batter ferments.
1. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.
1. Hence you should place the Homemade Ragi Idli & Dosa Batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.
1. *To make the Mushroom Filling:Into a preheated pan, heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Add the onions, garlic and green chillies and saute until the onions become soft and lightly caramelized.
1. Once the onions have softened, add the tomatoes and saute until it becomes mushy.
1. Add the chopped mushrooms, red chilli powder, pav bhaji masala, chaat masala and salt to taste.
1. Saute until you get a thick mushroom masala and all the moisture from the mushroom masala evaporates - it will take 5 minutes.
1. After about 5 to 7 minutes, once the masala has thickened, add the paneer, chopped mint leaves, give it a stir and turn off the heat.
1. *To make the Cheese Mushroom Dosa:Spoon a ladle full of ragi dosa batter into a preheated dosa pan and spread it in circular motion to make the dosa.
1. Drizzle a little ghee and allow the dosa to get cooked from the top.
1. Spread the mushroom masala evenly all over the dosa.
1. Next, add the grated the Britannia cheese block all around as well.
1. Once the cheese melts fold the Cheesy Mushroom Masala Dosa in half and transfer into a serving plate.
1. Serve Cheesy Mushroom Masala Dosa Recipe with Coconut Chutney, Fresh Fruit Bowl and Kumbakonam Filter Coffee for a tasty and satisfying breakfast.
