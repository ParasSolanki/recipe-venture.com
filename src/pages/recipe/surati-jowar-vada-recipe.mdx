### Instructions

1. To begin making the Surati Jowar Vada Recipe, mix all the ingridietns into a bowl and add about 1/2 cup water to form a batter.
1. Rest the batter for atleast an hour and then start to fry them.
1. Heat the Kuzhi paniyaram Pan and add a drop of oil to coat the pan; once the pan is well heated scoop the vada batter using a scoop spoon.
1. Cover the pan and allow it to steam.
1. You will notice the top part of the vada getting cooked.
1. At this point you could add another drop of oil and then using a tiny flat spoon gently flip the vada so it can get cooked from the other side and crisp as well.
1. When you insert the back of the spoon or a knife in the center it should come out clean - this is the test to check whether it is has been cooked.
1. Continue the same process with the remaining batter.
1. Serve the Surati Jowar Vada Recipe as a snack recipe along with adrak chai or Punjabi Style Espresso Coffee.
