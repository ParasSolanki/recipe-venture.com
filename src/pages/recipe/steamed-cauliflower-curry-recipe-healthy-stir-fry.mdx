### Ingredients

- 1 Cauliflower (gobi) - cut into florets.
- Sunflower Oil - for cooking.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- Black pepper powder - to taste.
- 1 sprig Curry leaves.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Steamed Cauliflower Curry Recipe, we will first steam the cauliflower.
1. You can use a steamer or a pressure cooker to steam it.
1. If you use a pressure cooker, place the florets in the pressure cooker, sprinkle some salt, add a tablespoon of water and cover the cooker.
1. Place the weight on and pressure cooker for just one whistle.
1. As soon as you hear one whistle, turn off the heat and release the pressure immediately by placing the cooker under running cold water.
1. This will release the pressure immediately and stop the cooking process immediately.
1. Open the cooker and you will notice the cauliflower is lightly steamed and is also firm.
1. This is exactly the texture we want for the cauliflower curry.
1. Our next step is to season the cauliflower curry to give it taste.
1. Here is where you can experiment with your spices, but I am keeping it simple.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a wok or a kadai; add the cumin seeds, curry leaves and allow it to crackle.
1. Stir in the black pepper powder and finally the steamed cauliflower and stir fry it until the cauliflower gets well coated with the pepper and cumin.
1. After about a minute turn off the heat.
1. Transfer the Steamed Cauliflower Curry to a serving bowl and serve it for a quick weeknight dinner or pack it into your lunch boxes.
1. Serve Steamed Cauliflower Curry along with Boondi Raita and Phulka for a weekday lunch or dinner.
