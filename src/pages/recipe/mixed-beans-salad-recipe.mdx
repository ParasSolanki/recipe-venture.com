### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mixed Beans Salad recipe, we will first cook the beans until soft.
1. For cooking the beans first wash and soak them in enough water for at least 6 hours.
1. Once soaked, drain the beans and transfer to the pressure cooker.
1. Add salt, garlic cloves, 1 cup water and close the lid of the pressure cooker.
1. Place the weight on and allow the beans to cook over medium heat until you hear two to three whistles.
1. After two to three whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for another 10 minutes.
1. After 10 minutes turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally as the beans will continue to cook under the existing pressure.
1. Once done, open and drain the excess liquids.
1. You can use this in soups or even when cooking rice.
1. Allow the beans to cool completely.
1. Our next step is to prepare the dressing for the salad.
1. Add all the ingredients for dressing like the olive oil, white wine vinegar, mayonnaise,dijon mustard , black pepper powder and salt in a bottle with the lid.
1. Tightly close the lid and shake the bottle so all the ingredients get well combined.
1. To prepare vegetables for the salad, finely chop bell peppers and onion and transfer to a bowl.
1. Stir in the halved cherry tomatoes and the cooked beans, the spring onion greens and coriander.
1. Pour the salad dressing and give the mixed beans salad a good stir and serve.
1. Serve the Mixed Bean Salad immediately along Light And Creamy Broccoli Soup and Fettuccine (Tagliatelle) Pasta with Tomato Basil Sauce for a complete meal.
