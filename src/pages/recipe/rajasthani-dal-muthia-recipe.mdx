### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rajasthani Dal Muthiya recipe, firstly we will begin with the dal.
1. Add mogar dal, green chillies, salt and turmeric powder in a pressure cooker with required amount of water.
1. Cook it till the cooker releases 3 whistles.
1. Open the lid and mix it properly using a spoon.
1. (if you want the dal watery, you can add hot water according to your preference)The next step is to temper the dal.
1. Heat ghee in a tadka pan and add mustard seeds, red chili powder, asafoetida, dry red chillies and salt.
1. (You have already added salt while boiling the dal, so make sure that you add extra according to your taste).
1. Pout the tadka on the dal and garnish it with chopped coriander leaves.
1. To make muthiya, add flour, ajwain, salt in a large mixing bowl.
1. Mix it well.
1. Slowly add the oil and water to make a dough out of it.
1. Once it is done, cover it with a cloth and keep aside for 15 minutes.
1. After 15 minutes, make medium sized balls out of the dough and keep it aside.
1. Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan.
1. Once the oil is hot, turn the heat to low.
1. Take the flour ball and press it between your hand using your fingers.
1. Once it is done, drop the muthiya into the hot oil and fry it from both sides till it becomes light brown in colour.
1. It will take some time to cook, so donâ€™t be in a hurry to take it out.
1. Take it out on a tissue paper to remove the extra oil.
1. Follow the same process for the remaining dough and serve it hot with the dal.
1. Serve Rajasthani Dal Muthiya on its own with fried chillies and Masala Chaas for a delicious weekend lunch.
