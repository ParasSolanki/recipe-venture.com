### Ingredients

- 1 Ridge Gourd (Turai/ Peerkangai) - skin peeled and cut into thin rounds.
- 1 tablespoon Green Moong Dal (Whole) - whole.
- 2 Dry Red Chilli.
- 5 grams Tamarind.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 2 tablespoon Coriander (Dhania) Seeds.
- 1 cup Dosa rice.
- 1 tablespoon Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal).
- 5 tablespoon Fresh coconut.
- 1 teaspoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).
- 1 tablespoon Jaggery.
- 1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Karnataka Style Heerekai Dosa Recipe soak the rice along with chana dal, green gram and fenugreek seeds with enough water for about 8 hours.
1. Grind the soaked rice and lentils along with coriander seeds, cumin seeds, dry red chillies, turmeric powder, fresh coconut, jaggery, tamarind and salt.
1. Grind into a smooth batter.
1. Do not keep the batter too runny or too thick.
1. Add it to a large bowl and keep it ready.
1. Heat a dosa tawa, dip the ridge gourd in the dosa batter just like Bajji and place one in the center and place more ridge gourd rounds dipped in batter around the center next to each other to form a flower-like pattern on a moderately hot tava that has been seasoned with oil.
1. Fill the gaps with little batter, drizzle some oil, cover and cook the dosa on a low to medium flame.
1. Cook a little extra since you need the vegetable to cook through.
1. Now gently flip the dosa and cook on the other side.
1. Do the same for the rest of the ridge gourd pieces.
