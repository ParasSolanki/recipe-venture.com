### Instructions

1. To begin making the Broccoli Malai Kofta Recipe, combine all the ingredients for the kofta in a large bowl.
1. Adjust the salt to suit your taste.
1. Make bite-size broccoli malai kofta balls and keep aside.
1. There are two ways we can cook these koftas without deep frying them.
1. One is the Oven Method.
1. If you plan to bake the kofta's; then place the kofta balls on a greased baking sheet.
1. Brush the kofta balls with some oil and bake in a preheated oven (200 C) until the koftas turn golden brown in colour.
1. Remove the kofta's from the oven once baked and keep them aside.
1. The Second is the Kuzhi Paniyaram Pan Method.
1. If you plan to use the Kuzhi Paniyaram Pan; then place the kofta balls in the pan's cavities; drizzle the kofta's with a little oil and pan fry them until golden brown on both sides.
1. You will have to flip the kofta balls so they fry on all sides evenly.
1. The next step is to make the Kofta Curry Base.
1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add the grated ginger, and honey and saute for about a minute until the honey begins to bubble.
1. Add the tomato puree, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, chilli powder, coriander powder and simmer the kofta gravy for about 5 minutes until the raw smell from the tomatoes goes away.
1. Add in the hung yogurt, 1 cup of water, salt to taste, the pan fried kofta's and simmer for another 5 minutes and serve.
1. Serve the Broccoli Malai Kofta with a soft Phulka's and a Paneer Pulav for a weeknight dinner or for your parties when you call friends over.
