1. After 10 minutes turn off the heat and using a wooden stick/back of wooden spatula mix vigorously until the Mosaru Kodubale dough comes together and resembles a chapati dough.
1. This dough should not be too stiff or too soft.
1. Once the dough cools down a bit, knead well by greasing your hands and keep aside.
1. While shaping the Kodubale keep the dough covered at all times.
1. Now pinch a small amount of dough roll it into a cylinder and then join the ends to make a  small ring, repeat with remaining dough, place on a butter paper, keep it covered all time.
1. Heat oil to deep fry in a Kadai and fry in batches.
1.  Make sure not to clutter the oil.
1. This Mosaru Kodubale Recipe needs to be consumed warm since these do not have a good shelf life.
