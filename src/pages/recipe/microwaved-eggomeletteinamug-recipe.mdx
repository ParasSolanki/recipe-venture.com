### Ingredients

- 1/4 tablespoon Onions - finely chopped.
- Salt - to taste.
- 4 Egg whites.
- 1/2 teaspoon Black pepper powder.
- Sunflower Oil - for greasing the cups.
- 1/4 cup Green Bell Pepper (Capsicum) - or any colour.
- 4 Whole Eggs.

### Instructions

1. To make the Microwaved Egg-Omlette-In-A-Mug first grease 4 microwaveable cups with oil.
1. Then, crack the eggs and add additional egg whites from 4 eggs into a mixing bowl.
1. Add pepper powder, salt, finely chopped bell peppers and onions into the same bowl and whisk well until combined and frothy.
1. Pour the egg mixture into the greased cups, equally, taking care to fill only 3/4 of the cup.
1. One at a time, place the cups in the microwave and cook on high power for 2 minutes each.
1. If you see the mix bubbling out of the cup, stop the microwave, remove the cup out and mix once, place it back into the microwave and cook.
1. Insert a fork into the cup and if it comes out clean the omelette is cooked and ready.
1. If the fork comes out eggy, you need to cook the egg for a minute or two more.
1. Mix it once and place it back into the microwave.
1. Cook until the fork comes out clean.
1. Serve the Egg-Omelette-In-A-Mug along with some toast and Banana Almond & Prunes Smoothie for a hearty breakfast.
