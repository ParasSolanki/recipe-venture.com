### Ingredients

- Ragi Dosa Batter - as needed.
- 2 Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- 2 Onions - finely chopped.
- 3 Carrots (Gajjar) - grated.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Ragi Dosa Carrot Onion Uttapam, make sure you have the fermented Ragi Idli Dosa Batter ready.
1. Next, combine the remaining ingredients and keep aside.
1. (except the oil and dosa batter)Heat a skillet on medium high heat, season it with oil if you are using an iron skillet.
1. Check if the skillet is hot, you will know when you sprinkle some water and it sizzles.
1. When hot, pour a ladle full of the Ragi Idli Dosa Batter onto the skillet and just give it a lite swirl to spread it just a bit.
1. It should be a like a thick pancake.
1. Sprinkle a generous amount of the carrot onion filling over the Uttapam.
1. Drizzle some oil around the Uttapam and cover if you have a lid, else you can let it cook in the open.
1. Once you notice the top is lightly steamed and the batter is not raw, press the filling down with a flat spatula.
1.  Then flip the Uttapam to cook on the other side.
1. Turn the heat to medium high, so the vegetables cook fast.
1. After about 30 to 40 seconds flip again and the Uttapam will be ready to be served.
