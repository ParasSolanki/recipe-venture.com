1. Add chopped onions and saute till raw smell goes off.
1. Now add ginger garlic paste and fry well till golden.
1. Now add turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chili powder and the achari masala along with chopped tomatoesSaute until the tomatoes soften.
1. Meanwhile slit the baingan from the middle into two but keep the joint intact.
1. This is done so that the masala gets inside the aubergine nicely while cooking.
1. Add the baingan in the fried masala and mix well such that everything incorporates well.
1. Add little amchur if required and stir well.
1. Add little water just to make sure the masala doesn't stick to the bottom of the heavy bottomed pan.
1. Add salt as per your taste and slow cook the baingan in low flame with lid closed.
1. Once the baingan softens, turn off the heat and garnish with freshly chopped coriander and stir.
