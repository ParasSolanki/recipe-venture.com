- 1 Onion - chopped.

- 1 cup Kabuli Chana (White Chickpeas) - soaked and boiled.
- 4 cloves Garlic - chopped.
- 1 teaspoon Dried oregano.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chickpea and Broccoli Quesadilla Recipe, pressure cook the boiled chickpeas in a pressure cooker with 2 cups of water for 6-8 whistle.
1. Once done allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Add the boiled chickpea into a blender and blitz it into a coarse mixture and keep it aside.
1. Heat a sauce pan with oil, add onions and garlic, saut√© until they soften.
1. Add in the ground chickpeas and broccoli and stir fry them for 5 minutes.
1. Add in the spice powder and seasoning and mix well.
1. Saute for another 5 minutes until the spice powders are cooked.
1. Switch off the heat and mix cream into the stuffing and coat it well.
1. The filling is now ready for the Chickpea & Broccoli Quesadilla.
1. We will move onto making the tortillas by clicking on our recipe link.
1. Our next step is to grill the Quesadillas.
1. Preheat a cast iron skillet while we fill and prepare the quesadillas.
1. Spread butter or low-fat spray on one side of the large tortilla.
1. With heat on medium, place the buttered side down on the skillet.
1. Spoon over some filling over one-half of the tortilla, leaving about 1/2 an inch space from the edge.
1. Sprinkle some grated cheese over this filling.
1. Fold over the empty half of the tortilla, covering the filling, making a semi-circular quesadilla.
1. Heat this side until the bottom-surface develops deep golden-brown spots and the cheese melts.
1. This would take about 2 to three minutes.
1. Press down the Quesadilla so the cheese melts.
1. Once the bottom has turned golden and crisp, flip the Quesadilla over carefully and allow the other side to brown up.
1. Once done, transfer to the serving plate.
1. Using a pizza cutter or a knife, cut to form triangular portions of the quesadilla.
1. Serve the Chickpea and Broccoli Quesadilla along with salsa and sour curd by the side with a bowl nachos as an accompaniment.
1. It can also be had with a bowl of Couscous Salad with Raw Mangoes.
