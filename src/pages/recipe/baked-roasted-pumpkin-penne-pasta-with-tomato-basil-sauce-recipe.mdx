1. Once the water has boiled, add a teaspoon of salt.
1. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until the pasta is cooked till al dente (just cooked).
1. This process should take a good 12-15 minutes to get an al dente pasta.
1. Once the pasta has cooked, drain the water and run the cooked pasta under running water to stop the cooking process and prevent the pasta from sticking to each other.
1. Drizzle some oil on top of pasta and make sure to coat all of the pasta with the oil so that the pasta doesn't stick to each other.
1. To Make the Tomato Basil Sauce First boil the tomatoes with required water in a saucepan.
1. Once you see the tomato skin peeling, switch off the heat.
