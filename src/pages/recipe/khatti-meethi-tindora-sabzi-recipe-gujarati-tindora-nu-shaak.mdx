### Instructions

1. To begin making the Khatti Meethi Tindora Recipe, we will first steam the vegetable in a steamer or a pressure cooker.
1.  If you are using a pressure cooker, cut the tinda into the desired shape, either into rounds or into think slices.
1. Place the cut vegetable into the pressure cooker, sprinkle some salt and 2 tablespoons of water.
1. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and cook the tinda until you hear two whistles.
1. After two whistles, turn off the heat.
1. We will now release the pressure immediately, by running the pressure cooker under cold water.
1. By doing this, we are making sure we don't over cook the vegetable and at the same time retain the nutrition content.
1. Open the pressure cooker once the pressure is released and keep it aside.
1. Our next step is to season the vegetable with spices.
1. Heat the oil in a large wok or a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Once the oil is heated; add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds.
1. Allow them to crackle.
1. Next add in the curry leaves, the steamed vegetable and the remaining ingredients except the roasted peanuts and the chopped coriander.
1. Saut√© the tindora sabzi until all the spices get well coated and combined onto the vegetable.
1. The tindora sabzi will have a soft and juicy texture to it.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Turn off the heat once you achieve this consistency (about 3 to 4 minutes of stir frying).
1. Finally stir in the peanuts and the chopped coriander leaves.
1. Transfer the Tindora nu shaak to a serving bowl.
1. Serve Khatti Meethi Tindora Sabzi Recipe along with Gujarati Kadhi, Methi Thepla and Steamed Rice for a weekday dinner.
