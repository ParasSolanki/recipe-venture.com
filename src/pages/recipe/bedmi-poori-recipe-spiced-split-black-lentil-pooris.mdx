1. To begin making the Bedmi Pooris Recipe, first dry roast the red chilies, coriander seeds and cumin seeds until they are lightly toasted and aromatic.
1. Take care not to burn them.
1. Cool them down and grind into a coarse powder and reserve for later use.
1. Drain the water from the soaked urad dal/split black lentils and add it to the blender.

1. Add the wheat flour to this and gradually add a little water at a time, as needed, to knead the dough.
1. Knead it well to make medium soft consistency dough which is firm, yet soft and pliable.
1. Cover the dough with damp cloth and rest it for 30 minutes.
1. After 30 minutes, knead the dough one more time, thoroughly.
1. Divide it into 18-20 equal sized small balls about the size of a golf ball.

1. Take one ball at a time and and roll out into a disc of 4 inches.

1. Once done remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and place on absorbent paper.
1. Proceed the same way with the rest of the dough till none remains.
1. Serve the Bedmi Pooris with Dubki Wale Aloo or Aloo Tamatari Curry for a wholesome breakfast.
