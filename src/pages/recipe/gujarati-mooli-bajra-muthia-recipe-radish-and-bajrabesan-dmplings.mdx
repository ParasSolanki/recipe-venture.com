### Instructions

1. To begin making Gujarati Mooli Bajra Muthia Recipe, we will first make the Muthia dough.
1. To make the muthiya dough, in a mixing bowl, combine the radish, radish leaves, bajra flour, whole wheat flour, besan, ajwain, dhaniya-jeera powder, hing, turmeric powder, green chilli paste, ginger garlic paste, coriander leaves, oil, lime juice, sugar and salt to taste.
1. Add some water and mix till everything just comes together.
1. Do not knead the dough too much.
1. We are looking for a stiff firm dough.
1. Prepare logs of dough that are 1-1/2 inch thick.
1. you can form around 2-3 logs as per convenience of kneading lightly with palms.
1. Prepare a steamer and keep it on medium heat to preheat.
1. Grease the steamer plate with some oil.
1. Place the logs on it and steam covered for about 15-20 minutes.
1. Insert a knife to check if they are done.
1. The knife should come out clean when the Muthia is steamed.
1. Allow them to cool and slice the logs to about 1 inch thick.
1. In a non-stick pan, heat cooking oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and once they sizzle, add in the curry leaves, fennel seeds and sesame seeds.
1. Add the sliced Mooli Bajra Muthia and fry them on medium heat till they turn to a light golden colour.
1. Serve Gujarati Mooli Bajra Muthia Recipe (Steamed and Tempered Grated Radish And Bajra-Besan Dumplings) on its own or with chutney of choice, like Dhaniya Pudina Chutney Recipe (Green Chutney) or Lahsun ki Chutney for snacks.
