1. Once done add the garlic cloves and roast them until the raw smell of the garlic goes away.
1. Once done add the desicated coconut, salt to taste.
1. Roast until lightly golden in colour and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the garlic mixture to cool.
1. Once the mixture has cooled completely add it to the blender and blend to make a coarse powder.
1. Keep aside.
1. The next step is to make the Vada for the Vada Pav.
1. Into a preheated pan add oil.
1. Once the oil is hot add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Once the mustard seeds have crackled add the onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies, asafoetida and saute until the onions soften and turn golden brown in colour.
1. After the onions have changed colour add the boiled potatoes, turmeric powder and salt to taste.
1. Mix well to combine and saute for 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Finally add the chopped coriander leaves, stir to combine and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the potato mixture to cool down before making the vadas.
1. While the potato mixture is cooling make the vada batter.
1. Into a mixing bowl add gram flour, turmeric powder, ajwain, salt to taste and add little water at a time to make a thick lump free batter which coats the back of the spoon.
