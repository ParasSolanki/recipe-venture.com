### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - chopped.
- 1 Green Chilli.
- 200 liter Coconut milk.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 teaspoon Rice flour.
- 1/4 cup Fresh coconut - grated.
- 1/4 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 2 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.

### Instructions

1. To make Hirve Kaalvan, first wash coriander leaves in water to remove dirt and dust particles.
1. Pat dry coriander leaves with a kitchen towel.
1. Roughly chop them and transfer to a bowl.
1. To make paste for the curry, in a blender or food processor add grated coconut, chopped coriander leaves, green chilli, salt and cumin seeds using 1 - 2 tablespoon of water grind to make a smooth paste.
1. Transfer the paste to a bowl and keep aside until required.
1. Now take a 2 tablespoon of the coconut milk and dissolve rice flour to it.
1. Stir to make a lump free smooth mixture.
1. Make sure rice flour is fully dissolved in coconut milk.
1. Add this to the remaining  coconut milk and whisk it all together to form smooth lump free mixture.
1. Next, heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
1. Once the oil is heated add coconut and coriander paste made earlier to the pan.
1. Stir the paste continuously to avoid sticking to the pan.
1. If still paste sticks to the pan, reduce the flame to low.
1. Pour coconut milk into the paste in the pan along with turmeric.
1. Stir to combine and if you feel the curry seems too thick, you can adjust the consistency adding water.
1. Allow the curry to simmer on a low flame for about 3 to 5 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Note: You can make the curry and keep it refrigerated and simmer only when you are ready to serve.
1. This way we don't overcook the curry and the nutrition is not lost.
1. Serve the Hirve Kaalvan with steaming hot rice for a weeknight dinner or even lunch.
