### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Dates - (pitted) finely chopped.
- 1/4 cup Jaggery - grated.
- 1/2 Badam (Almond).
- 8 Leftover roti.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Malida Recipe, tear the Roti to bite sized pieces.
1. Process the roti to coarse texture using Food Processor.
1. You would get about approximately 3 cups of the roti mixture.
1. Keep this aside.
1. The next step is to process the dry fruits.
1. First add the almonds and make a course powder.
1. Into a large mixing bowl, add the powdered almonds, chopped dates, cardamom powder and jaggery.
1. Stir well to combine.
1. Keep this mixture aside.
1. Our next step is to lightly roast the roti powder in ghee.
1. Heat a heavy bottomed pan on low heat and melt the ghee.
1. Add in the Roti powder and stir well.
1. Roast the whole wheat roti for about 5 to 7 minutes or until the powder is hot enough.
1. The reason we roast on low heat, is so that it becomes crisp slightly and the heat also helps in binding the remaining ingredients to make the malida.
1. Add this toasted powder to the wide bowl with other ingredients.
1. Combine all the ingredients together using your hand.
1. Once mixture feels wet, start making small bite balls out of the Malida Mixture.
1. Malida would be little sticky while making balls but the jaggery will get hard and hold shape once it rests for a few minutes.
1. Serve the Malida as a tea time snack or as a healthy lunch box snack for kids.
1. This sweet is packed with nutrition and goodness that you can have it as a quick energy booster for those long work days.
