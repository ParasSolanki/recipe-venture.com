### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Rice.
- 1 liter Milk - full fat.
- Few Saffron strands.
- 2 tablespoons Dried rose petals.
- 1/4 cup Sugar -.
- Mixed nuts - pistachio and almonds for garnishing.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Gulab Phirni Recipe, soak the rice in water for half an hour.
1. Drain water and pulse in a grinder till you get a grainy consistency.
1. The grains should feel gritty between your fingers and should be slightly bigger than semolina.
1. Bring the milk to a brisk boil in a large saucepan, add the rice and saffron while whisking continuously.
1. Turn the heat to low and keep stirring to avoid lumps.
1. Keep stirring the mixture every couple of minutes.
1. After about 20 minutes the mixture will start to thicken.
1. Simmer the phirni mixture for another 20 to 25 minutes till it thickens considerably and the rice is completely cooked.
1. Stir Occasionally to avoid the Phirni from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
1. Once done add the sugar and mix till it dissolves.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the Phirni mixture cool.
1. Once it's cooled completely, transfer to a mixer-grinder and pulse for exactly 5 seconds.
1. This helps to give the phirni a creaminess and remove any lumps.
1.  You can also use a hand blender as well.
1. Stir in the rose petals and transfer the Gulab Phirni into serving bowls.
1. Garnish with chopped pistachios, almonds and rose petals.
1. Cool the Gulab Phirni in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight and serve cold.
1. Serve Gulab Phirni Recipe along with samosas and Mawa Gujiya With Badam and Pista Recipe to guests during festive occasions.
