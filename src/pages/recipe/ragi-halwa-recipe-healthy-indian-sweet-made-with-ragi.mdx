### Instructions

1. To prepare this yummy Ragi Halwa Recipe | Healthy Indian Sweet Made With Ragi, soak Ragi for at least 12 hours in water and get ready with the other ingredients as well.
1. In a saucepan, cook jaggery and 1 cup of water until it is melted (Syrup is not required).

1. In a tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee and fry the cashews until golden.
1. Set aside.
1. Drain the water from the ragi through a sieve and remove excess water.
1. Add Ragi and 1 cup of water in a mixer/blender and blend until very smooth and fine, this helps in extracting as much ragi milk as possible.
1. Slowly add another cup of water into this and blend further.
1. This process should take about 7-10 minutes depending on the power of your mixer/blender.
1. Now pass this liquid through a fine muslin cloth/cheese cloth and separate the ragi milk from the meal.
1. Grease a Thaali/rimmed steel plate with some ghee and keep it ready.
1. In a wide and deep pan add 2 cups of the extracted Ragi milk, jaggery water and 3 cups of milk and bring this to a boil by mixing with a wooden flat spoon.
1. Cook this mixture on medium to high heat, whilst stirring continuously.
1. After about 20 minutes of cooking and continuous stirring, add 1 tablespoon of Ghee and continue to stir about 10 minutes.
1. You will notice thickening and starts to coat the back of the wooden spoon.
1. Wet your hands lightly and touch the surface of the halwa, it shouldnâ€™t stick to your wet hands.
1. Cook for a further of 5-6 minutes and whisk in the Cardamom powder and fried cashews.
1. Pour the mixture onto a greased thaali and let it cool to room temperature.
1. Run a freshly washed Knife to cut the halwa into squares or diamond shaped ragi halwas.
1. This Ragi Halwa Recipe is a great dish for toddlers and growing children since it is sweetened so you can also serve it after having Bisi Bele Bath Recipe (A Spicy Mixed Vegetable Sambar Rice) to have a sweet note at the end.
