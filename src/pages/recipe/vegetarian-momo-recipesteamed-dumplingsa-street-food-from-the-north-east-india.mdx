- 1/2 cup Cabbage (Patta Gobi/ Muttaikose).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vegetarian Momo we will first knead the dough for the Vegetarian Momos cover.
1. Method to make the momo coverAdd the flour into a large mixing bowl.
1. Add a little water at a time and knead to make a smooth dough.
1. Once the dough comes together, keep kneading for about 5 minutes to make it smooth and elastic.
1. The dough should not be sticky.
1. Cover the dough and keep it aside for half an hour.
1. Method to make the filling for the momo You can use a turbo chop to chop all your vegetables individually or you can even finely chop them up.
1. Once done combine all the chopped vegetables in a bowl.
1. Check, the salt levels and add the oil to it as well.
1. Mix well to combine.
1. Our next step is to fill and shape the momosDivide the dough into small lemon size portions.
1. Keep the dough covered with a muslin cloth.
1. Dust the dough in flour and roll out into a circle of 2 to 3 inch diameter.
1. Do not roll too thick, as the filling will push itself out and tear when steamed.
1. Place a small spoon of filling in the center of the rolled circle.
1. Wet the edges with little water to help seal the momos.
1. Bring together the edges of the dough with a pinching and folding motion on one side and bring the other side to hold to the pinched side.
1. By doing this, the half moon shaped momos will have a frilled look.
1. Proceed the similar way with the remaining dough.
1. You can experiment with different shapes and sizes that you like.
1. All it takes is some time and practice.
1. As you keep shaping the momos, you need to keep them on a greased platter and cover with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out.
1. While you are shaping the momos, keep a steamer with water boiling.
1. Grease the steamer pan with some oil to prevent the momos from sticking.
1. Place the shaped vegetarian momos on the greased steamer pan.
1. So when you have one set of shaped momos, place them in the steamer and steam on high for 5 to 7 minutes until you see a glaze on the skin.
1. The skin will begin to shine.
1. As soon as you notice this, turn off the heat.
1. Transfer the Vegetarian Momos from the steamer into a serving platter and serve hot.
1. Serve the Vegetarian Momo Recipe along with Chilli Garlic Sauce as a Part Appetizer for any occasion with a party meal of Vegetarian Hakka Noodles,  Soy Chunks Manchurian Recipe In Sweet & Spicy Chinese Sauce and Toffee Banana.
