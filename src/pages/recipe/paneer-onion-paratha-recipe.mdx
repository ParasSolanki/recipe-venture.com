1. Now make even size ball out of paratha dough and roll out the ball into a small circle dusting wheat flour.
1. Add some stuffing in the centre and gather all the corners and seal it well and press it lightly.
1. Dust some wheat flour and roll out the sealed dough into a circle as we do for chapati dough.
1. Donâ€™t apply too much pressure.
1. Heat a tawa, on medium - high flame and put the rolled out Paneer Pyaz Paratha on it.
1. Let it cook a little bit on one side.
