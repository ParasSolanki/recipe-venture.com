1. To prepare Gulkand Kala Jamun Recipe, proceed with making khoya balls first.
1. How to make Khoya BallsIn a large mixing bowl, add khoya with maida, sooji and baking powder and gently knead to form a soft dough.
1. Do not knead heavily, just gather the mix together and form a lump, cover it with a muslin cloth and keep aside to rest for 10 mins.
1. Heat sufficient oil in a wok for deep frying.
1. Meanwhile prepare the balls.
1. Grease your hands lightly with ghee and pinch a small lemon sized ball from the dough mix.
1. Make a depression in the center with your index finger and drop little gulkand, small pinch of cardamom powder and few chopped nuts in the center.
1. Fold the dough mix from the sides towards inside and seal the ball.
1. Now gently roll the ball between your palm and keep aside in a tray.
1. Similarly make many more balls from the dough mix and line them on a tray.
1. How to make Sugar SyrupTo make sugar syrup, in a saucepan add water and sugar and allow it to come to boil.
1. Now add saffron, rosewater and cardamom powder and let the sugar cook with water till it gets a one string consistency.
1. Turn off heat and keep aside.
1. Frying the khoya ballsWhile the sugar syrup is getting done, start by heating a deep frying pan with enough oil to deep fry.
1. As soon as the oil is medium hot, lower the flames to medium heat and drop in the gulkand stuffed khoya balls in equal batches.
1. Remember not to overcrowd the kadai.
1. Simmer the gas and allow the balls fry from all sides till they turn almost black in color.
1. Transfer the fried balls on a kitchen napkin for about 30 seconds, or until to drop the second batch into oil.
1. Transfer to the prepared sugar syrup.
1. Turn off the gas and drop the fried balls in the syrup and let them rest for sometime so that the syrup gets inside the balls nicely.
