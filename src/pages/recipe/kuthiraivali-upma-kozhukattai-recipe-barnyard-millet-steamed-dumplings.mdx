### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon White Urad Dal (Split).
- 1/2 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- 5-6 Curry leaves - finely chopped.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/2 cup Fresh coconut - grated.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 1 cups Barnyard Millet.
- 1 tablespoons Sesame (Gingelly) Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kuthiraivali Upma Kozhukattai Recipe, we will first cook the barnyard millet (Kuthiraivali) into an upma like consistency.
1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add the mustard seeds, urad dal and allow them to crackle.
1. Allow the urad dal to get roasted and lightly browned.
1. Stir in the curry leaves, ginger, green chillies, asafoetida and the barnyard millet (Kuthiraivali).
1. Stir fry for about 3-4 minutes until lightly roasted.
1. Stir in the coconut and about 1 cup of water and salt to taste.
1. Stir the mixture continuously and allow the mixture to come to a boil.
1. Once the upma mixture comes to a boil, turn the heat to low, cover the pan.
1. The mixture will begin to thicken in about 10 minutes and leave the sides of the pan.
1. Make sure to keep stirring to avoid lump formation.
1. Once cooked, turn off the heat and spread the mixture on a plate and allow it to cool.
1. Prepare a steamer filled with water and with steamer plates or idli plates greased with a little oil.
1. Divide the cooled rice upma mixture into 20 portions and shape them into oval dumplings.
1. While making the dumplings, keep a small bowl by the side with a little oil.
1. Rub our hands with a little oil before you make each dumpling, this will prevent the Upma Kozhukattai from sticking to the palm of your hands.
1. Arrange the Upma Kozhukattai in the steamer plates and place into the steamer.
1. Steam for about 10 minutes on high heat.
1. Turn off heat, remove the plates from the steamer and allow it to rest for a few minutes before you can serve them.
1. Serve the Kuthiraivali Upma Kozhukattai Recipe along with Puli Ingi for breakfast or a light dinner.
