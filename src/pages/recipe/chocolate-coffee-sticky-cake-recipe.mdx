### Instructions

1. To begin making Chocolate Coffee Sticky Cake Recipe, first set your oven to pre-heat at 180 degrees C for 15-20 minutes while you get the ingredients and the batter ready.
1. Next, prepare your 9" bundt pan by thoroughly buttering it.
1. Smear butter all over the insides of the pan, spreading it with your fingers.
1. Next, sprinkle flour all over the buttered surface, tapping it with the heel of your palm so the butter spreads evenly.
1. Set this aside till you are ready to use it.
1. Take a mixing bowl and sift together the flour, baking soda, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg baking powder and salt into it.
1. Mix well and set this aside.
1. In saucepan melt the chocolate chips, coffee powder and water over a medium-low heat, while stirring constantly.
1. Turn off the heat and set the saucepan aside to cool.
1. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and brown sugar, using a hand-beater, on a high speed till it looks light and fluffy.
1. To this, add the melted chocolate mixture and beat briefly, till well combined.
1. Next, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
1. Also add the vanilla extract and mix well.
1. Now, reduce the speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture and beat well till well combined and no lumps remain.
1. The batter will be runny, this is how it is meant to be, so do not panic.
1. Lastly, fold the walnuts in to the batter using a spatula and pour the batter into the bundt pan.
1. Set the pan into the oven to bake at 180 degrees C, for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the pan comes out clean.
1. Once baked, remove the bundt pan from the oven and set it aside for 10 minutes to cool slightly, on a wire rack.
1. When cooled, gently place a plate over the pan and swiftly turn the pan over to release the cake onto the plate.
