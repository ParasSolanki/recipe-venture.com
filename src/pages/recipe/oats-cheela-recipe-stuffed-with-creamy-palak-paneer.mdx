### Instructions

1. To begin making the Oats Cheela Stuffed With Palak & Paneer Recipe, in a mixing bowl combine the flour and that oats, add little water at a time to make a semi thick batter.
1. The batter should be the consistency of the dosa batter so you can spread it easily on the tawa.
1. Keep this aside.
1. The next step is to prepare the filling.
1. Add Nutralite Classic into a wok on medium heat.
1. Add the chopped spinach, sprinkle some salt and saut√© until the spinach wilts down and all the moisture is evaporated.
1. Once the moisture is evaporated, add the crumbled paneer, cumin powder, chilli powder, salt to taste and Nutralite Veg Mayo.
1. Stir fry for a minute and turn off the heat.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Preheat a skillet/ dosa tawa over medium heat.
1. Pour a ladle full of the oats cheela batter over the tawa and spread in a circular motion to make a thin crepe/ cheela.
1. Spread the Nutralite classic around the cheela and allow it to melt.
1. Cook the Oats Cheela on both sides by flipping over, until it turns lightly golden and crisp.
1. Once done, remove the Oats Cheela from the skillet and place it on a platter.
1. Place the creamy palak paneer filling in the center of the cheela and fold it into half and serve.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining cheela batter.
1. Serve the Oats Cheela Recipe Stuffed With Creamy Palak Paneer along with a Papaya Banana Smoothie for a wholesome high protein breakfast.
