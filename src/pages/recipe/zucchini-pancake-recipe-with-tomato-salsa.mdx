### Instructions

1. Whisk together all the ingredients until well combined and fully.
1. Heat a 8 inch pan over medium heat and melt 1/2 teaspoon butter or 1/2 teaspoon oil in the pan.
1. When the butter is hot but not smoking, lower the heat to medium-low and drop one heaping soup spoon of batter into the pan.
1. Cook the pancake about 2 minutes on each side, until browned and cooked on both sides.
1. Continue with remaining pancakes.

1. If you happen to warm in the oven, just make sure to cover with aluminum foil so they dont dry out.
