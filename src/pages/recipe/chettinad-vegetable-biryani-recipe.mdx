### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chettinad Vegetable Biryani Recipe, get all the ingredients ready and keep them aside.
1. The first step is to roast all the spices.
1. In to a pan, add the cloves, cardamom, pepper, fennel seeds, cinnamon, star anise and stone flower.
1. Roast for about a minute until you get a roasted aroma.
1. Once roasted, grind to make a fine powder of the spices.

1. The next step is to make the Chettinad Veg Biryani.
1. Heat ghee or oil into the pressure cooker over medium heat.
1. Add the onion, ginger, garlic and saute until the onions soften.
1. Once the onions are softened, add the tomatoes, and cook until the tomatoes soften.
1. Finally add the vegetables, the Biryani Masala, coriander powder, red chilli powder, rice and saute for a few minutes until the rice is coated with the masalas.
1. Stir in the mint leaves and salt.
1. Add 2 cups water and pressure cook the biryani for 2 whistles.
1. After 2 whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure releases, open the cooker and allow the Chettinad Veg Biryani to rest for about a minute before you stir.
1. In the meanwhile, heat ghee over medium heat.
1. Add the cashew nuts and roast until golden and crisp.
