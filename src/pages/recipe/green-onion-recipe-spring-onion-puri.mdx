### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 teaspoon Ajwain (Carom seeds).
- 1/4 cup Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - finely chopped.
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- Sunflower Oil - to deep fry.
- 1/2 cup Spring Onion Greens - finely chopped.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Hare Pyaaz Ki Puri Recipe, we will first make the puri dough.
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour along with oil, cumin seeds, ajwain, salt, spring onion greens, and  coriander leaves.
1. Mix well and add water little by little to knead and form a stiff puri dough.
1. Add a few drops of oil once the dough ahs come together and evenly smoothen out the dough.
1.  Cover the Hare Pyaaz Ki Puri dough and allow it to rest for a while.
1. Preheat oil in a kadai to deep fry the puris on high flame.
1. Divide the Hare Pyaaz Ki Puri dough into equal portions to make lemon sized dough balls.
1. Dust them with flour and roll the dough ball into a 3 inch diameter, using a rolling pin.
1. We need evenly flattened puris of medium thickness.
1. Once the oil is well heated, drop the flattened Hare Pyaaz Ki Puri into the oil and fry the puris .
1. Fry the Hare Pyaaz Ki Puri  with a spider strainer, continuously yet gently pouring oil onto the puri and allowing it to puff.
1. Due to the addition of the spring onion greens, cumin seeds and ajwain, the puri won't fluff up like the classic plain puri.
1. It will just about fluff up a little more than a phulka.
1. Remove the Hare Pyaaz Ki Puri from the oil and place on an absorbent paper.
1. Serve hot.
1. Serve Hare Pyaaz Ki Puri Recipe along with Amritsari Chole Recipe (White Chickpeas In Spicy Gravy) or Batata nu Shaak Recipe - Aloo Tamatar Ki Sabzi, Boondi Raita, Pickled Onions followed by a sweet dish of Mukhadi Halwa Recipe.
