### Instructions

1. To begin the preparation of Whole Wheat Ravioli with Paneer & Creamy Mushroom Oat Sauce Recipe, first make the ravioli pasta dough.
1. In a large mixing bowl, add the flour and salt; knead to make soft dough by adding little water at a time.
1. Once the flour comes together, knead well for about 3 to 5 minutes to make soft and smooth dough.
1. Cover and keep the dough aside till we prepare the filling.
1. To make the filling, combine the paneer, oregano and salt.
1. Adjust taste and keep aside.
1. Divide the whole-wheat ravioli dough into 2 equal portions.
1. Roll each half into a very thin rectangular sheet with a rolling pin.
1. Make sure you use enough flour to dust the surface and the dough to roll it out.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining portion of the two and make two sheets.
1. Once you have rolled the sheets, we need to shape and fill these sheets and shape them into raviolis.
1. To shape ravioli, I use a ravioli tray.
1. This helps to hold the filling and also shape it evenly.
1. Dust the sheets with more flour and place it on the ravioli tray.
1. Lightly press the sheet into the cavities to make a depression for the filling.
1. Spoon a small portion of the filling into the depression.
1. Take care not to over stuff it.
1. Place the other ravioli sheet over this filled sheet.
1. Using the rolling pin press, close and cut the ravioli.
1. You will notice it forms impressions on the edges.
1. When you over turn this, the individual ravioli pieces will comes out.
1. Dust the filled ravioli with a lot more flour and keep it aside till you are ready to use it.
1. You can refrigerate it and make it when you are ready with the sauce.
1.  To make the mushroom sauce, heat oil in a wok over medium heat.
1. Add the garlic and mushrooms and saut√© on high heat until you notice the mushrooms begin to soften a little.
1. At this stage, add the milk, Italian oats, chili flakes, salt and herbs.
1.  Add water if required to adjust the consistency of the sauce.
1. Cook until you get a good saucy consistency, something that is not too thick and not too runny.
1. Once cooked through, check the salt and seasonings and turn off the heat.
1. When you are ready to serve the ravioli, bring a large pot of water to boil.
1. Add ravioli pasta and cook for 5 to 8 minutes.
1. You will notice the ravioli pasta pieces rising to the top.
1. Once you notice they rise to the top, allow them to boil for a few more minutes and remove them from the boiling water and place it on a greased tray.
1. To serve, spoon the sauce on a serving bowl or a platter, place the cooked ravioli pasta over the sauce.
1. Add some chili flakes.
