### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Tamarind Paste.
- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 8 Dry Red Chillies - adjustable.
- 2 teaspoons Red Chilli powder - optional.
- 8 cloves Garlic.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 kg Tomatoes.
- 1 teaspoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).
- 1 tablespoon Mustard seeds.
- Sunflower Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Andhra Style Tamati Pachadi recipe, take the chopped tomatoes in a deep bottomed pan.
1. Add salt, turmeric & tamarind to them.
1. Keep the pan on medium heat & boil till they loose all the water & turn into a mushy paste alike.
1. Keep stirring in between.
1. Meanwhile when the tomatoes are boiling, take another pan, heat 2-3 teaspoons of oil.
1. Add the mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds.
1. Once they crackle, add dry red chillies.
1. Fry them till they become fragrant.
1. Once done, cool them & grind them into a smooth powder.
1. Add the ground masala that we made in step two to the tomatoes & mix well.
1. If you think that the chillies aren't spicy enough, then add red chilli powder according to your preference at this step.
1. Once again heat 5 tbsp oil, add the garlic pods & mustard seeds to it.
1. Once the garlic turns brownish & the seeds crackle, switch off the stove & let them cool.
1. Add the tempered mixture to the chutney.
1. You can even add some urad dal or chana dal to this tempering.
1. But make sure to add this tempered oil mix only when it is completely cooled off.
1. This is important as it makes sure the chutney stays fresh for a long time.
1. Serve Andhra Style Tamati Pachadi along with Ghee Masala Dosa and Homemade Soft Idlis for your breakfast or as your tea time snack.
