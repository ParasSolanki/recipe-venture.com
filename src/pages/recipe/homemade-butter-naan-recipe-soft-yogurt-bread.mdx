1. To begin making the Butter Naan recipe, in a large bowl add the 3 cups of flour and butter.
1. With your hands, blend the butter into the flour until it forms coarse crumbs.
1. You can do this in a blender as well, but the dough when worked with hands gives a better texture to the dough.
1. Stir together the warm water, yeast  and sugar until yeast is completely dissolved.
1. Now make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yogurt, salt and yeast mixture.
1. Knead into the flour and until the whole dough collects into a mass.
1. Add a little more water if required to bring the dough together.
1. The dough will be wet and sticky.
1. Wipe your hands clean and oil them.
1. Now knead the naan dough with the oiled hands until smooth , for about 10 minutes; oil your hands more if the dough is sticky.
1. The dough after 10 minutes of kneading will still be soft and pliable.
1. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl and  allow the dough to rest for 3 to 4 hours until the dough has doubled in volume.
1. Once the naan dough has doubled, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into 12 to 15 equal portions.
1. With a rolling pin, quickly roll out each ball into a 5 inch oval.
1. With your fingers, stretch each round into a 5-7 inch oval.
