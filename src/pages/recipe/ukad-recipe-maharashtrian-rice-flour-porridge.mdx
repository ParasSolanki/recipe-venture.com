- 3 tablespoons Rice flour - fine.
- Salt - to taste.
- 5 cloves Garlic - peeled.
- 1/8 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 1 Green Chilli - chopped.
- 8 tablespoons Water - or as required.
- Asafoetida (hing) - a pinch.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Ukad recipe, whisk the rice flour, curd, water and salt in a bowl.
1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan and add mustard seeds, let it splutter.
1. Add the turmeric, hing and the curry leaves, whole garlic cloves, let the garlic turn a light brown (ensure not to burn).
1. Next, add the chilli and make sure you don't burn it.
1. Swiftly add the rice flour concoction and stir continuously with a spatula.
1. Add about 2-3 tablespoons water if you canâ€™t stir it easily.
1. Using a spatula mix till its thick and till it smells cooked, this would take approximately 5 minutes.

1. I love mine with ghee/tup.
1. Serve Ukad along with ghee or along with Maharashtrian Tomato Saar for a simple weeknight dinner.
