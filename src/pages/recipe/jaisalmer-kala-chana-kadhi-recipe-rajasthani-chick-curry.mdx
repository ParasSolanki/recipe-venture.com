### Ingredients

- 1 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).
- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1/2 cup Kala Chana (Brown Chickpeas) - soaked overnight in water.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/4 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- 1/2 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- 1/4 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 1 Green Chilli - chopped.
- 2 tablespoons Gram flour (besan).
- 1 teaspoons Ghee.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Jaisalmer Kala Chana Kadhi, pressure cook the soaked chickpeas with water and salt for at least 5 to 6 whistles.
1. It will take about 20 minutes to cook the Kala chana.
1. Keep this aside.
1. We will first start by combining all the main ingredients in a large saucepan.
1. Add besan, yogurt, 2 cups of water,salt, turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chilli powder and whisk it all together, until it forms a smooth paste without lumps.
1. Place the saucepan on medium heat and bring the Kadhi mixture to a boil.
1. While the Kadhi is boiling, keep whisking it continuously, so it becomes smooth.
1. Continue to whisk it until you notice it has begun to thicken and the Kadhi is smooth.
1. Once it is beginning to become smooth, add the kala chana into the kadhi.
1. You can optionally mash a few kala chana and add into the Jaisalmer Kala Chana Kadhi.
1. Simmer for a good 10 minutes.
1. The more you simmer, the tastier the kadhi gets.
1. To temper the Jaisalmer Kala Chana Kadhi, heat a small tempering pan with ghee, add cumin seeds and green chilies and pour it on top of the kadhi and serve hot.
