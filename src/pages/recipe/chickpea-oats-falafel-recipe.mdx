### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chickpea & Oats Falafel Recipe, we will first cook the soaked chickpeas until it is very soft.
1. I personally like to use a pressure cooker.
1. Click here to see how to cook chickpeas in a pressure cooker.
1. You will know the chickpeas is cooked well, when you press it between your fingers, it will mash up.
1. The next step is to proceed to make the falafel.
1. Combine the oats, all purpose flour, garlic, parsley, cumin powder, pepper powder, salt,  and the cooked chickpeas in a food processor.
1. Blend to make a coarse thick paste.
1. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Divide the falafel batter into small portions of the size of a ping pong ball and flatten them slightly.
1. I used a Kuzhi Paniyaram pan to fry the falafels and the result is very similar to the deep fried ones.
1. Add a half a teaspoon of oil into each of the cavities, place the shaped falafel into the cavities and pan fry them until it is crisp and browned on both sides.
1. Add few more drops of oil when you flip over to fry them on the other side.
1. This will help in getting the even color for the falafels.
1. You can alternatively, heat oil for deep-frying and deep fry these falafels until browned evenly on all sides.
1. Serve the Chickpea Oats Falafel along with Lemon Coriander Hummus and Tabbouleh and Pita bread for a wholesome weeknight dinner.
