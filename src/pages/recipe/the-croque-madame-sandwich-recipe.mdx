### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 tablespoons Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 cups Milk.
- Butter - for cooking the sandwiches.
- 6 Whole Wheat Brown Bread.
- 1/4 teaspoon Nutmeg - ground.
- Salt and Pepper.
- 3 Whole Eggs.
- 2 teaspoons Dijon Mustard.
- 1/3 cup Cheese - grated or cheese slices.
- 1 1/2 tablespoons Butter.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Croque Madame Sandwich Recipe, we will first make the Bechamel Sauce.
1. To make the bechamel sauce, in a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
1. Add in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until you can smell the aromas of the lightly roasted flour.
1. Take care not to allow the butter to turn brown or get burnt.
1. Once the flour is lightly roasted, add the milk and nutmeg and keep stirring continuously until the mixture thickens.
1. Once it thickens and forms a creamy consistency, turn off the heat and transfer the Bechamel sauce to a serving bowl.
1. The next step is to make the sandwich.
1. Grease and heat a cast iron skillet on medium heat.
1. Arrange the 3 slices of bread, sprinkle the cheese and spread the bechamel sauce on the top and finally cover the bread with another slice.
1. Add a couple of tablespoons of butter on the cast iron skillet and allow it to melt.
1. Place the bechamel sandwiches on the top of the butter and grill the sandwiches  on the skillet until you see the cheese melting and also the sandwich is crisp from both the sides.
1. Once the sandwiches are well grilled, place them on a serving platter, drizzle more bechamel sauce on the sandwiches and sprinkle some cheese while it is hot.
1. You can choose to broil the cheese and sauce under a broiler to melt the cheese or simply serve it as it is.
1. The final step is to make the fried egg for the Croque Madame Sandwich.
1. In the same cast iron skillet or another skillet, heat a teaspoon of oil or butter and crack the 3 eggs onto the skillet keeping some space between each egg.
1. You can also fry one egg at a time if your skillet is small.
1. Once the eggs are fried, place them on top of the grilled sandwiches.
1. Serve Croque Madame Sandwich as a perfect weekend breakfast along with a bowl of fruits and Espresso Coffee.
