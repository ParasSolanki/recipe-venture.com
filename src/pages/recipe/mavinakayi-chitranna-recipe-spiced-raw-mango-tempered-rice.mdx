- 1/4 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 2 cups Cooked rice - (leftover works fine).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mavinakayi Chitranna Recipe, we will first prepare the rice.
1. If you don't have day-old rice, cook your rice till fluffy, spread it out in a wide plate and allow it to cool completely.
1. This helps in ensuring the rice doesn't get soggy, sticky and clumpy.
1. Follow Steamed Rice Recipe - Pressure Cooker & Saucepan Methods to cook rice.
1. Next, heat gingelly oil in a heavy bottomed wok or kadai.
1. Add the mustard seeds, chana dal, split urad dal and roast the dals on medium flame until the dals turn golden brown in colour.
1. Once the dal turns golden brown, add in the curry leaves, asafoetida, and slit green chillies, saute for a few seconds until the aromas of the asafoetida and curry leaves come through.
1. Now we will add the grated raw mango, turmeric powder and saute until the mangoes become a bit tender.
1. This will take about 2 minutes.
1. Once the mangoes have softened, add the cooked rice, salt to taste and stir well to combine.
1. After 2 to 3 minutes,  stir in the chopped coriander leaves, mix it well and switch of the gas.
1. Taste Mavinakayi Chitranna and adjust salt, add more raw mango if required if you like it to be more tart.
1. Transfer Mavinakayi Chitranna to a serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve the Mavinakayi Chitranna Recipe along with a Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita or High-Protein Peanut Chutney and a roasted papad for lunch or even for dinner.
1. The Mavinakayi Chitranna makes a great picnic lunch too.
