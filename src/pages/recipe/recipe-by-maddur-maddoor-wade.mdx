### Instructions

1. To begin making the Maddur Vada Recipe prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for the Maddur Vada dough without adding water.
1. The dough will be a little stiff and more like a bread crumb consistency.
1. After the dough gets combined, cover the dough and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.
1. This resting process will bring out the moisture - as the onions will release a little water when exposed to the salt.
1. After 10 minutes, knead the dough again and you will notice it will come together like a firm roti dough.
1. If you feel the Maddur Vada dough did not have enough moisture, then add a few drops of water at a time and knead to make a very firm roti dough.
1. Divide the Maddur Vada dough into large lemon size balls.
1. Preheat the oil for deep frying the Maddur VadaNow to make the Maddur vada, grease your palms with a little oil and also grease a small piece of aluminum foil with  oil as  well.
1. This helps in sliding maddur vada into the hot oil easily.
1. Take a small ball of the Maddur Vada dough and pat it flat over the foil with your greased fingers.
1. You can keep it little thick and not too thin.
1. Carefully slide the Maddur Vada from the oil into the hot oil and deep fry on both the sides for about 1 minute over medium heat until dark golden brown and crisp.
1. Based on the size of your kadai, you can deep fry 2 to 3 Maddur Vada at a time.
1. Once golden brown and crisp, remove the Maddur vada from the oil and drain it over a kitchen paper napkins and serve hot.
1. Serve the Maddur Vada as a Tea Time Snack along with Spicy Coconut Chutney and a hot cup of filter coffee.
