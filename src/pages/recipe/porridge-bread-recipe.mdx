### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 1 cup Khichdi/Pongal.
- 1/4 cup Rice flour - or as needed.
- 1/4 cup Onion - finely diced (optional).
- Sunflower Oil - as needed.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Khichdi Roti recipe, cut out a large baking paper to the size of your tava and smear it with some oil.
1. In a mixing bowl add khichdi (use room temperature or cold, hot kichdi will get messy), enough rice flour, very little salt to adjust the seasoning and chopped onions.
1. Mix them all together, you should get a well combined mixture and not very moist, if you still find it very moist add in an extra tablespoon of rice flour at a time.
1. Meanwhile, heat the tava on low flame.
1. Place a golf ball sized mixture on the baking sheet and smear some oil on your palm and pat it on the baking sheet to resemble a round roti.
1. You can pat it as thin or as thick as you like.
1. Now transfer the sheet onto the hot tava and let it sit for 15-20 seconds and then peel off the baking paper gently.
1. Drizzle some oil around it and cook until golden brown and flip onto the other side.
1. Adding the rice flour totally depends on the consistency of your khichdi, needs a bit of eye balling in the measurement of rice flour.
1. Serve Khichdi Roti with Burani Raita and Aam Ka Achaar for a perfect meal.
