### Instructions

1. To begin making the Karela Besan Sabzi, first prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. It always helps in making the dish in a more organized way.
1. Karela skin does not have to be peeled, it's important to cut it along with its green skin for maximum benefits.
1. Also avoid soaking the karela in water to remove the bitterness.
1. The bitterness is exactly what that adds to the nutrition.
1. Only discard the hard seeds if the pulp is not tender.
1. Into a pressure cooker, add the cut roundels of karela, along with turmeric powder, salt and two tablespoons of water.
1.  Cover the pressure cooker and cook for 2 to 3 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Once done, release the pressure immediately by running it under cold water or by releasing it with a fork placed under the whistle.
1. The next step is to make the Karela Besan Sabzi masala.
1. Heat oi in a wok or a kadai over medium heat; add the ajwain and allow it to crackle for a few seconds.
1. Add the onion, garlic and ginger and saute until the onions become soft and golden.
1. This will take about 3 to 4 minutes in medium heat.
1. Once the onions are golden, add the cooked karela, besan, amchur powder, red chilli powder, coriander powder and garam masala powder.
1. Stir to combine all the ingredients well.
1. Check the salt and add more if required.
1. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer the Karela Besan Sabzi for about 3 to 4 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Check the seasonings and spices and adjust to suit your taste accordingly.
1. You can optionally add jaggery to give it additional taste.
1. If you are diabetic you can avoid the jaggery.
1. Once done, transfer the Karela Besan Sabzi to a serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve the Karela Besan Sabzi along with Rajasthani Kadhi and Methi And Palak Paratha for a wholesome weeknight or weekend dinner.
