1. Grease the pan with butter and wipe it with a tissue paper.
1. Next, pour a ladle full of batter on the skillet, lift it with the handle and swirl it around, in a way that the batter spreads on the entire skillet.
1. Cook on low heat for 2-3 minutes, you will see the that the crepe is almost cooked leaving no wet patches of the batter,  flip on the other side for a minute and take it off the skillet and place it on a plate.
1. Ensure that your crepes get absolutely no colour or maybe just a tad bit of brown.
1. The next step is to make the filling for the crepes.
1. For Bacon and Caramelised Onions Cheese filling, in a pan, add butter and heat on medium flame.
1. Add the sliced onions, sugar and saute till the onions are soft and have turned into a nice golden brown colour.
1. Turn off the flame, add salt, pepper, mixed herbs and mix.
1. Heat the same pan on medium heat and add the bits of bacon, saute for about 4-6 minutes or until you get crisp bits of bacon.
1. Add this to the onion mixture and mix well.
1. The final step is to assemble the Bacon, Caramelised Onions And Cheese Crepes.
1. Keep the crepe flat on the plate, and place the bacon and onion filling on one quarter of the crepe.
1. Sprinkle cheese generously on the filling and fold it into a triangle.
1. To get a triangle shape, first fold into a semi-circle, then fold the semi-circle into half again.
