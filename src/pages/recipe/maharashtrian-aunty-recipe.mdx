### Instructions

1. To begin making the Maharashtrian Amti recipe, first rinse dal in water thoroughly.
1. Add ¾ cup water, turmeric powder and place it in pressure cooker to cook on a high heat.
1. When you hear a whistle, turn the heat down and allow 2 more whistles to happen.
1. Turn the heat off now and allow the pressure from the cooker to release gradually on its own.
1. When you are able to uncover the cooker with ease, you will know the pressure has released fully.
1. Mash the dal with the back of a ladle and mix it well to make a uniform, well cooked texture.
1. Set it aside for use later.
1. Place a kadai on the heat, add the mashed cooked dal to it and allow it to simmer on a low heat.
1. At this stage, if the dal is too thick, add water to get the desired consistency.
1. Once dal starts to boil, add goda masala, jaggery and tamarind juice.
1. Stir well and let it cook on low heat for 10 minutes or until it is uniformly cooked.
1. In a small tadka pan heat oil and ghee together.
1. Add mustard seeds and allow them to crackle.
1. Add cumin seeds, asafoetida, curry leaves, green chilies and sauté for a minute.
1. Add the tempering to the dal and switch off the flame.
1. Garnish with fresh chopped coriander leaves and serve hot with fresh steamed rice and a dollop of ghee.
