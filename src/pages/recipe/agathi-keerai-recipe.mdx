### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 1/4 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1/4 cup Yellow Moong Dal (Split) - soaked for 2 hours.
- 2 Dry Red Chillies.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 1 tablespoon Jaggery.
- 3 tablespoons Fresh coconut.
- 500 grams Agathi keerai - washed and coarsely chopped.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Agathi Keerai Recipe, we will first cook the Agathi Keerai and the Moong Dal.
1. I am assuming the Moong Dal has been soaking for a couple of hours.
1. When we soak it, it will take less time to get cooked along with the greens.
1. Once soaked, drain the excess water from the dal.
1. Place the chopped Agathi Keerai and the soaked Moong Dal into the pressure cooker.
1. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water, sprinkle some salt and cover the pressure cooker.
1. Place the weight on and pressure cook the greens and the lentils until you hear a couple of whistles.
1. Turn off the heat after the couple of whistles and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure has released naturally, our next step is to season the Agathi Keerai.
1. Heat oil in a pan, add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, red chillies, curry leaves and asafoetida.
1. Allow them to crackle.
1. Add the steamed Agathi keerai and moong dal, coconut, jaggery and salt to taste.
1. Stir gently to combine the ingredients for a couple of minutes.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Turn off the heat and transfer to a serving bowl and serve.
1. Agathi Keerai can be served with Mixed Vegetable Sambar and Steamed Rice for a weekday lunch.
