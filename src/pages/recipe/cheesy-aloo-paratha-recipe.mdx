- 1/4 cup Cheese - processed and grated.
- 1/2 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 inch Ginger - grated.
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 1/2 teaspoon Chaat Masala Powder.
- 1/2 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- 1 Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- Asafoetida (hing) - a pinch.
- 1 Dry Red Chilli - broken and deseeded.
- Water - required for kneading.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/4 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 2 Potato (Aloo) - boiled.

### Instructions

1. In a wide bowl, add wheat flour, salt, oil, needed water and prepare a soft and smooth dough.
1. Cover and keep it aside for 15-20 minutes.
1. Dough should not be too hard.
1. The next step is to prepare the stuffing.
1. Pressure cook potatoes for 3 whistles or until soft.
1. Peel the skin and mash them well.
1. Heat oil in a non-stick pan.
1. Add dry red chili and cumin seeds.
1. Once it splutters, add hing/asafoetida, finely chopped onions, green chillies, ginger and pinch of salt and saute until onions turn transparent.
1. Adding salt while cooking onions, prevents it from sticking and getting burnt.
1. Then add the mashed potatoes, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, kitchen king masala powder/ garam masala powder, chaat masala and salt and saute for 3-4 minutes till everything gets blended well.
1. Be careful while adding salt at this stage, as we have added a pinch of salt to onions.
1. Plus we are using chaat masala and cheese, so the stuffing will require less salt than usual.
1. Check the salt level and add salt accordingly.
1. Lastly, add 1/4 cup grated cheese and finely chopped coriander leaves, mix well and leave it to cool.
1. Before starting to make parathas, knead the dough well.
1. If needed, use 1/2 teaspoon oil and knead till it becomes smooth and soft.
1. Divide the dough and stuffing into equal parts and make balls out of it.
1. This will make 4 parathas.
1. Dust a little flour and roll out the dough into a small circle.
1. Keep stuffing in the center, gather all the corners and seal the dough with the stuffing inside.
1. Press it down gently to flatten it.
1. Dust a little four and roll it again very gently, so that stuffing doesnâ€™t come out.
1. Heat a tawa/non stick pan and place the paratha.
1. Cook the paratha using little oil/butter/ghee till golden brown spots appears on both sides.
1. Repeat the same steps to make more parathas.
1. Serve Cheesy Aloo Paratha along with Boondi Raita and Dhaniya Pudina Chutney for a filling breakfast or serve it for weekday dinner.
