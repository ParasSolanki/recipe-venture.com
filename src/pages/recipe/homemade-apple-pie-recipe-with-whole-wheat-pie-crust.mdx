### Instructions

1. To begin making the Homemade Apple Pie Recipe, We will first make the apple filling.
1. For the Filling:In a large bowl, add the sliced apples brown sugar, white sugar, salt, cinnamon powder and flour.
1. Mix all the ingredients until the apples are well coated and combined.
1. To make the crust:To make the crust by hand, combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.
1. Work the chilled butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse sand.
1. Sprinkle ice water onto the crumbly dough and with your hands push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together.
1. Add just enough water to bring the dough together.
1. There should not be too much moisture in the dough and the dough should be firm.
1. Divide the dough into two, cover in cling film wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.
1. To make the crust in a food processor, add the butter and place them in the bowl of the food processor.
1. Add the flour, salt and sugar.
1. Process until all of the ingredients are incorporated.
1. With the processor on, add the ice water a tablespoon at a time until the dough begins to clump but is still crumbly.
1. Continue to drizzle a little water and pulse the food processor, stopping to test the dough with your fingertips to see if it is moist enough to hold together.
1. When you can gather the dough into a ball, remove it from the food processor.
1. Refrigerate the Pie Crust for at least 2 hours.
1. Grease a pie pan with butter and keep it ready.
1. Preheat the oven to 165 degree C.
1. Final Assembly of the Apple Pie:After two hours, we are now ready to work on the pie dough.
1. Generously flour the work surface.
1. Place one portion of  the chilled pie crust on the floured surface and using the heel of your palms, press down the dough to make it flat and pulling it outward to stretch the dough.
1. Now with the help of a rolling pin roll out the dough to a large round of quarter inch thickness.
1. Once rolled, gently transfer to your prepared pie pan.
1. Unfold the pie dough and gently press it in so that the dough fills out the inner edges and corners.
1. Some pastry will still hang over the sides of the pan; We will use this to cover the pie to the top later.
1. Roll out the second pie dough the similar way and keep aside.
1. Pour apple mixture over the pie dough in the pie tin and spread it around evenly.
1. Drape the second rolled dough over the filling.
1. Fold the overhangs over the edges sealing them together.
1. Combine the milk and honey in a bowl and brush the top of the apple pie, this gives a good colour to the crust.
1. Finally, cut small slits to act as vents all over lid so the steam can escape through and retain just the enough moisture needed for the apple pie.
1. Place the pie crust in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown for about 40 to 45 minutes.
1. After about 45 minutes when you notice that the crust is golden, it indicates that the apple pie is ready.
1. Remove from the oven and allow the pie to rest for about 10 minutes.
1. Cut the Homemade Apple Pie into wedges, drizzle some icing sugar on the top and serve warm along with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
1. Serve the Homemade Apple Pie Recipe as a Party dessert after a meal of Vegetable Au Gratin with Cauliflower Carrots and Beans and Whole Wheat Rosemary Focaccia Bread Recipe.
