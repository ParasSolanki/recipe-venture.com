### Instructions

1. To begin making the Roasted Vegetable Quesadilla Recipe, first prep all the ingredients and keep them ready for cooking.
1. In a heavy bottomed pan, add a teaspoon of oil and the spring onions, chopped carrots and zucchini.
1. Saute the zucchini and carrots until they soften a bit.
1. Once lightly softened, add the chopped red cabbage and sprinkle salt to taste.
1. Stir to combine the salt.
1. Cover the pan and allow the vegetables to get cooked until they have a firm bite to it and yet feel cooked.
1. Once the vegetables are well roasted and begin to start sweating, add the cumin powder and tabasco sauce and stir well to combine.
1. Turn off the heat and keep the roasted vegetables aside.
1. The next step is the make the dough for the tortillas; add the flour to a large mixing bowl, salt and mix well.
1. Add little water at a time and knead to make a firm and smooth dough.
1. Once all the flour has come together, drizzle a little oil in the top and knead again to make a perfect non sticky dough.
1. Divide the dough into very large lemon size balls and keep aside.
1. Dust the ball in flour and start rolling into a tortilla of 8 inches in diameter.
1. Preheat a pan over medium heat and place the rolled out dough on the pan.
1. Keep pressing, flipping and turning the tortilla, until it gets cooked on both the sides.
1. Keep pressing around the edges to allow it to get cooked evenly and gets slightly puffed.
1. Alternatively you can also place it on a gas flame and allow it to puff like how you make phulka.
1. Once the tortillas are cooked turn the heat to low; add a few tablespoons of the roasted vegetable to one side of the tortilla.
1. Evenly spread the grated cheese on the top.
1. Fold the empty side of the tortilla over the filled side to make a semi circle.
1. Press it down, drizzle oil and cook the Roasted Vegetable Quesadilla until golden and crisp on both sides.
1. Serve the Roasted Vegetable Quesadilla along with Greek Yogurt Dip for a quick weeknight dinner or as a snack for the kids.
