### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chicken Taquitos Recipe, we will first make the tomato salsa.
1. To make the tomato salsa We will first cook the tomatoes in a pressure cooker.
1. Add half the tomatoes and place it in the pressure cooker along with 2 tablespoons of water.
1. Allow it to pressure cook for 2 whistles.
1. After 2 whistles, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure releases, open the cooker, drain out the excess water and allow the tomatoes to cool completely.
1. Once the tomatoes are cooled, peel the skin off the tomatoes and chop them fine.
1. Place the chopped tomatoes in a mixing bowl.
1. Add the onions, green chillies, salt, sugar, cumin powder, Tabasco sauce, tomato puree and coriander leaves.
1. Mix the tomato Salsa well to combine.
1. Check the taste and keep the Mexican salsa aside.
1. To make the Chicken Taquito FillingHeat a skillet with oil, on medium heat, add the garlic and saute till it releases flavours for a few second.
1. Add the chicken, 3 tablespoons of the freshly made tomato salsa, mix well and allow the chicken to cook until it is tender and just about done.
1. This will take about 3 to 5 minutes.
1. Once done, add salt and taco seasoning and continue to cook for about two more minutes, until the chicken is well cooked.
1. Transfer Chicken Taquito Filling to a bowl and set aside.
1. To make the corn tortillasIn a medium bowl, mix together the maize flour, all purpose flour, salt and mix well.
1. Make a smooth firm dough using the required amount of water.
1. Knead for a good 5 minutes until the dough is smooth.
1. Place the dough in a bowl, cover with a tight fitting lid or a plastic wrap and allow it to rest for half an hour.
1. Preheat a cast iron skillet or or a heavy bottomed skillet.
1. Divide dough into 6 to 8 to equal size balls.
1. Using a rolling pin, dust the dough portions on flour and roll out into a 6 inch diameter circle.
1. Place the rolled out tortillas on to the preheated skillet and allow to cook for approximately 30 seconds.
1. Flip over to the other side and cook the tortillas.
1. To assemble the Chicken TaquitosPreheat an oven to 200 degree Celsius.
1. Place a tortilla on the working counter, smear some tomato salsa on it, place the chicken filling in the center, top with some grated cheese, sprinkle some taco seasoning and close the tortilla like a rolling, fastening it with toothpicks to hold the chicken taquito.
1. This way assemble the rest of the Chicken Taquitos and place them on a baking tray.
1. Flash bake the Chicken Taquitos in the oven for a good 15-20 minutes, until the tortillas are nice and crisp.
1. Once done, remove from the oven and serve hot immediately.
1. Serve the Chicken Taquitos as a starter/ party appetizer over along with Mexican Vegetarian Bean & Cheese Enchiladas as a main course and a Rich Dark Chocolate Mousse for dessert to make your party a complete hit with family and friends.
