### Ingredients

- 1 Cup Basmati rice.
- 1 Cup Sugar.
- 2 Tablespoons Mixed nuts - crushed.
- 1/2 Cup Ghee.
- 2-1/2 Cups Water.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2 Tablespoons Raisins.
- 1 pinch Salt.
- 1 pinch Saffron strands.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Goan Dessert Sakhar Bhaat Recipe, wash rice well with water 3-4 times and leave it aside for 20 minutes soaking in water.
1. In a saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of ghee and fry cashew nuts and raisins for a minute.
1. Remove and keep aside.
1. In the same saucepan, add the remaining ghee, water, salt and saffron.
1. Mix and let it come to boil.
1. Once the water is boiled, add soaked rice.
1. Mix, cover it and cook on medium heat.
1. While covering, make sure not to cover it fully, so as to allow steam to escape.
1. Otherwise once the water and rice starts to boil, it starts to overflow.
1. After about 5-6 minutes water will be absorbed.
1. Now reduce the heat to low setting and cook till the rice is nice and soft.
1. Stir in between.
1. Once the rice is soft, add sugar, fried nuts, raisins and cardamom powder.
1. Mix well.
1. Cover and simmer on low for 5 more minutes and remove from heat.
1. Serve Goan Dessert Sakhar Bhaat Recipe as a dessert along with a Goan inspired meal of The Goan Kelyachyo Fodi, Tawa Paratha, Steamed rice and Potato Vindaloo Recipe (Spicy Goan Potato Curry).
