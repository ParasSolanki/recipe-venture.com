- 1/3 cup Coriander (Dhania) Leaves.
- 1 Green Chilli - finely chopped.
- 1 cup Jowar Flour (Sorghum).
- Salt - to taste.
- Ghee - to cook the dodas.
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Juvar Jo Dodo Recipe, we will first make the dough.
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the onion, methi leaves, coriander leaves, salt, green chilli, finely chopped  and mix well.
1. To this, add the jowar flour and cooking oil and mix until well combined.
1. Use just enough water to make a stiff dough.
1. Add a few drops of oil and smoothen out the dough.
1. Cover and set aside.
1. Heat a tawa on medium high flame.
1. Divide the dough into equal portions.
1. Use a wet thin napkin or parchment paper greased with oil and grease your fingers with oil.
1. Take a dough ball and begin flattening it on the greased sheets or wet napkin, using your fingers and palms.
1. We are looking for approximately 4 inch diameter dodo, of medium thickness.
1. Carefully over turn the sheet or napkin on the tawa, in a way that the flattened dough is on the surface of the tawa and the sheet is over that.
1. Now carefully, remove the sheet, ensuring the dodo is placed without breaking.
1. Slather some ghee and cook on both sides on medium flame.
1. We need it to cook in a way that we get lovely brown spots.
1. Repeat the same for the other portions of the dodo dough and cook in the same manner.
1. Serve the Juvar Jo Dodo hot on a platter.
