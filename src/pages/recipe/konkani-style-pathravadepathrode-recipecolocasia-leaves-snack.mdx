### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pathrode Recipe, wash and soak the rice and dal in water for 3 to 6 hours.
1. Wash the colocasia leaves, remove the stem & the large veins of the leaves with the help of a knife.
1. This will help them cook fast and make them less itchy.
1. Drain off the excess water from rice and grind all mentioned masala ingredients (except the leaves) to chutney/spread consistency.
1. Now first take the largest/biggest leaf.
1. Keep leaf upside down and smear a layer of masala on back side of leaf.
1. Place the second leaf on top of the first leaf & smear masala.
1. Repeat the process for 3 to 5 leaves.
1. In one pathravadev roll there should be minimum 3 leaves.
1. Now pathravade is ready for rolls.
1. Firstly fold the sides of the leaf towards the centre and then roll along length of the leaves to make a roll.
1. After it is rolled, smear the paste on top of it.
1. Once the rolls are done, steam cook these rolls 15 to 20 minutes.
1. Wait till the pathravade cools down a bit.
1. Once the pathravade is cooled, you can serve them in 2 ways.
1. Just slice them, smear little butter and relish or shallow fry them with coconut oil till they turn crisp.
1. Serve hot.
1. Serve Pathravade as a side dish along with your Konkan meal of Konkani Style Vengaya Sagle and Tawa Parathas during weekday lunch or dinner.
