### Instructions

1. To begin making the Jimikand ke Kebab Recipe, make sure you have all the ingredients handy.
1. We will be processing the ingredients for the kebab step by step.
1. It's ideal when you use a Food Processor, as it speeds up the process of making the kebabs.
1. To begin, add the coriander leaves, green chilli, ginger and garlic into the food processor and blend until you get a coarse mixture.
1. Transfer the contents to a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the cooked and mashed Jimikand(Yam) and the remaining ingredients except the oil and breadcrumbs.
1. Combine all the ingredients well.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. The next step is the shape the Jimikand Kebabs.
1. To prevent the kebabs from sticking to your hands, have a small bowl with a tablespoon of oil.
1. Grease your palms and fingers with the oil and shape the kebab dough into circular discs.
1. Once you shape them, roll them over bread crumbs and arrange them on a platter so you can cook them.
1. To cook the Jimikand Ke Kebabs, preheat a cast iron pan on medium-high heat and grease the pan well.
1. Place the shaped kebas, drizzle oil over them and pan fry them until crisp and brown on both sides.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining Jimikand Ke Kebabs and serve them immediately along with Green Chutney.
