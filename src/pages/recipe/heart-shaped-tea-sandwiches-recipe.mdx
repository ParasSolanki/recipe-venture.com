- 2 teaspoons Jam - (or any red colored fruit jam spread or preserve).
- 2 tablespoons Cabbage (Patta Gobi/ Muttaikose) - finely chopped.

- 12 Whole Wheat Brown Bread.
- 2 tablespoons Classic Mayonnaise (With Egg).
- 3 tablespoons Nutella Spread.

- 2 tablespoons Beetroots - peeled and finely chopped.
- 2 tablespoons Green Bell Pepper (Capsicum) - finely chopped.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Heart Shaped Tea Sandwiches recipe, firstly we will make the beet mayo filling.
1. Finely chop the vegetables includig beetroot, bell pepper, cabbage, spring onion greens or use a food processor (makes it easier and quick).
1. Transfer the chopped vegetables to a bowl.
1. Stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, black pepper powder and red chilli flakes (depending upon how spicy you want your sandwich) and mix well.
1. Do a taste test and adjust the spices and salt accordingly.
1. We had two sizes of heart-shaped cutters, so we used the bigger one for the beet-mayo sandwich and the smaller one for Nutella and jam-filled sandwiches.
1.  Take one slice of bread and place the cutters over them to get 2 heart shaped bread slices.
1. Continue with the other slices to make more heart-shaped slices; (the leftover bread can be used to make breadcrumbs).
1. Butter all the 12 larger heart-shaped bread slices for beet-mayo sandwiches on one side.
1. Gently place a small teaspoon of filling over half of the larger slices (about 6) and spread it evenly with a palette knife.
1. Place the other 6 slices (with just butter) with the butter side down on top of this and press lightly.
1. Dainty beet-mayo tea sandwiches are ready.
1. Now to make the Nutella and Jam sandwiches.
1. Over 3 of the smaller slices apply and spread Nutella gently.
1.  Place the other half over the top and press gently.
1. Nutella sandwiches are ready.
1. Similarly, make the Jam sandwiches.
1. Serve these delightful, dainty and pretty Heart Shaped Tea Sandwiches as a snack along with Masala Tea or Espresso Coffee.
