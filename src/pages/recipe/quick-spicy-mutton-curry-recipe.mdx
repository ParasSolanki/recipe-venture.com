### Instructions

1. To begin making the Quick & Spicy Mutton Curry recipe, grind all the ingredients listed under masala to a fine paste.
1. You may either marinate the meat with masala for an hour and then cook OR follow the steps below.
1. I personally like the marinated version as the meat catches on to the masala really well.
1. Heat the pressure cooker with some oil (3 to 4 tablespoon) add in the chopped tomato and cook till it turns mushy.
1. Next add in the meat and masala, cook till the raw smell disappears on medium simmer with constant stirring.
1. This should take about 4 to 5 minutes.
1. Add in 1 to 2 cups of water, basis the consistency of gravy required.
1. Check for spice and salt levels, adjust as per requirement.
1. Turn down the flame and let the meat cook for about 3 whistles or until well done.
1. Serve Quick & Easy Mutton Curry along with Whole Wheat Lachha Paratha and Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita for a weekend dinner.
