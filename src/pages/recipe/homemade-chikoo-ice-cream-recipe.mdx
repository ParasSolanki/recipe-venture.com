### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups Milk - full fat milk is required.
- 1 cup Sugar.

- 12 Chikoo (Sapota Fruit) - (sapotas) +1 chickoo for serving.
- 1/2 cup Milk Powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Homemade Chikoo Ice Cream Recipe by cleaning and peeling the chikoos/sapotas and deseed them.
1. Blend the fruit to make a smooth pulp with a hand blender or a mixer grinder and keep aside.
1. Take a big steel vessel, add the cooking cream, milk powder, sugar & milk, using a hand whisk well till no lumps remain.
1. Add the chikoo pulp and using a mixer, whisk it for 1 minute until all the ingredients are incorporated.
1. Taste the chickoo milk to adjust the sweetness.
1. Transfer the chickoo milk to an airtight container (I used the Tupperware Ice cream box), Let the ice cream set for 2 hours to look and feel like a soft serve ice cream, remove it again and churn it in mixer for 2-3 minutes, transfer it to the air tight box again.
1. This procedure is done to avoid crystallization of the ice cream.
1. Refreeze the ice-cream for 12-15 hrs.
1. Remember the freezer should be at maximum temperature & the ice-cream is made in air tight box.
1. Serve this Homemade Chikoo Ice Cream Recipe with a few pieces of chikoos.
1. Serve it as a dessert after your scrumptious meal of Paneer Pav Bhaji on a weekday.
