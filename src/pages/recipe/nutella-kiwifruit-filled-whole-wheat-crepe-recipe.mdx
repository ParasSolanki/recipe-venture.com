### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Sugar.
- 2 Whole Egg.
- 5 Kiwi - peeled and sliced.
- 1 cup Milk.
- Nutella Spread - for the crepes.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 pinch Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Nutella & Kiwifruit Filled Whole Wheat Crepe, first blend all the ingredients together in a blender until smooth.
1. Then strain the crepe mixture through a fine mesh sieve.
1. Pouring the mix into a tall jug makes it easier to portion out the batter when making crepes on a hot pan.
1. Allow the crepe batter to rest at room temperature for about 15 to 20 minutes.
1. This makes the crepes soft and fluffy.
1. To begin making the crepes, warm a crepe pan with a rim on a medium heat.
1. Butter or oil it evenly.
1. When the pan gets hot, pour just enough batter to cover the base, and start tilting and swirling the pan to spread the batter and make a thin film on the surface of the pan.
1. This film should be as thin as possible, and if there is excess batter pour it back into the jug.
1. Once you make a couple of crepes, you will understand how much batter your need to pour for a single crepe.
1. You could also use a measuring cup to pour the batter, so that way the subsequent times you will get it just right.
1. These crepes gets cooked really quick and you need to cook it just until the bottom begins to get a little golden, then gently lift the edges and flip the crepe to cook on the other side for a few seconds.
1. Transfer the prepared whole wheat crepes to a platter and cover with a dome lid to keep warm and soft.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining batter and stack the crepes one on top of the otherOnce the crepes are make, spread the nutella on the inside of the crepes, place the sliced Kiwifruit as a filling and fold it into a triangle.
1. Serve Nutella & Kiwifruit Filled Whole Wheat Crepes for a weekend breakfast along with Banana Almond & Prunes Smoothie, or as an after school snack to the kids.
