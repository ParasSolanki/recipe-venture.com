- 3 tablespoons Dill leaves - finely chopped.
- 1-1/2 cups Spinach Leaves (Palak) - pureed.
- 1 teaspoon Green Chilli Paste.
- 3 tablespoon Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/2 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- 1 teaspoon Ajwain (Carom seeds).
- 200 grams Tofu - grated.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Wheat Spinach And Tofu Paratha Recipe, first combine the flour with the oil/ghee and all the other ingredients mentioned, in a big mixing bowl.
1. Start kneading the dough, by adding a little water (if required) and working the dough until it comes together into a soft, pliable dough.
1. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and keep it aside for 15 mins.
1. After 15 mins, divide the dough into 14 to 15 equal sized balls, depending on the size of the paratha you prefer to make.
1. Take one ball, dust it with flour and roll it out into a disc of preferred thickness and size that you like the parathas to be.
1. Place the rolled out paratha onto hot griddle and allow it to cook until light brown spots appear on the underside and bubbles appear on top.
1. Brush with oil/ghee and flip and cook the other side as well.
1. Now brush the other side with oil/ghee and flip again, to ensure that both sides are uniformly browned.
1. Repeat with remaining portions of dough and serve hot along with a bowl of yogurt and pickle for breakfast, or pack it into your lunch box or even serve it for a weeknight dinner.
