### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rajma Galouti Kebab Recipe, we will first soak the rajma for at least 8 hours.
1. After the soaking period, cook the rajma along with salt until very soft.
1. If you press the rajma between your fingers it should mash easily.
1. To cook the rajma, place the rajma in the pressure cooker, add salt and 2-1/2 cups of water.
1. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and pressure cook until you hear 5 to 6 whistles.
1. After 5 to 6 whistles, turn the heat to low the simmer for about 20 minutes.
1. After 20 minutes of simmering, turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. The rajma will continue to cook under the pressure that exists in the cooker.
1. This will take another 15 minutes.
1. Once the rajma are cooked through completely, drain the excess water.
1. You can use the water in stocks or soups or even cooking rice.
1. We will now begin to make the Rajma Galouti Kebabs.
1. We will first grind the mint leaves, green chillies, ginger, garlic, cashew nut together in a food processor to make coarse mixture.
1. Next add in the rajma and blend again into the mixture.
1. Add this kebab mixture into a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the remaining kebab ingredients, except the oil and knead well to make a kebab dough.
1. Divide the mixture into 8 to 10 equal portions.
1. Shape the portions into round circular discs.
1. Our final steps is to cook the Rajma Galouti Kebab.
1. To do that, preheat a pan and grease it with oil.
1. Place the shaped Kebab portions on the preheated skillet.
1. Drizzle a few drops of oil over the kebabs and pan fry them on both sides until lightly crisp.
1. Proceed the same way to make the remaining Rajma Galouti Kebabs.
1. Place them on a serving platter and serve it along with Green Chutney.
