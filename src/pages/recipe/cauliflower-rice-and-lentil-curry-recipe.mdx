1. Heat oil in a wide pan, add mustard seeds and let them splutter add the cumin and cinnamon and allow the cumin to crackle, add curry leaves and turmeric , tip in the grated cauliflower and cook for a minute on a medium to high flame, add the tofu and mixed gently to combine.
1. Continue cooking for 2-3 minutes until the cauliflower is cooked, retaining a bite texture (not cooked very soft/mushy)Season with salt and dish it out onto a bowl.
1. In another pan heat oil add the onions and ginger-garlic paste and cook until the onions start to change color and now add the tomato puree and cook this mixture for 5-7 minutes.
1. Now add turmeric, chili powder, homemade garam masala, curry powder and salt, cook for 5 more minutes until the tomatoes start looking slightly reduced.
1. Now add the cooked lentils into this mixture and let it simmer for 4-5 mins until it absorbs all the flavors of the curry.
1. Pour in the coconut milk and gently stir it around and cook on gentle heat for a couple of minutes, adjust the salt and garnish with coriander.
1. Serve Cauliflower Rice and Lentil Curry with a nice Raita like Burani Raita or Lauki Raita or a fresh salad like Carrot Ribbon Salad With Asian Sesame Dressing.
