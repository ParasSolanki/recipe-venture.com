### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mirchi Bajji Recipe, coarsely grind the stuffing - ajwain and till along with salt in a mixer grinder and keep aside.

1. Check whether the oil is hot enough to deep fry, by dropping a small ball of batter in the oil.
1. If the batter ball sizzles and reaches the top of the oil, then the oil is ready for deep frying.
1. Dip each of the stuffed green chili in the above made batter and make sure that the stuffed green chili is properly covered with batter.
1. Drop down the batter covered stuffed chili , slowly from the corner of the kadai,Repeat the process and add 2-3 Chilli Bajji at a time, depending on the size of the kadai.
1. Do not overcrowd the kadai.
1. On medium heat, fry the Mirchi Bajji till they turn nice golden.
1. Drain the excess oil by placing the fried Mirchi Bajji on a kitchen paper towel.
1. Repeat to with the remaining stuffed chilies.
