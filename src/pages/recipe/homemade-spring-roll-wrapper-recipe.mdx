### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 3/4 cup Water.
- Salt - a pinch.
- 1/4 cup Corn flour.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the homemade Spring Roll Wrapper Recipe, combine the plain flour, cornflour, water and salt in a bowl and whisk well until well combined and there are no lumps.
1. The batter will be runny.
1. Heat and grease a nonstick pan with oil.
1. Once the pan is hot, with heat on medium, pour a ladle of the batter into the pan and tilt the pan around quickly to make a thin circle.
1. Cook on medium heat until you see the sides are beginning to peel off.
1. When the sides begin to peel off, turn the wrapper and cook on the other side for a few seconds.
1. Repeat with the remaining batter to make more wrappers.
1. Stack the Spring Roll Wrappers one above the other, greased with little oil and store in airtight containers and place them in the freezer.
