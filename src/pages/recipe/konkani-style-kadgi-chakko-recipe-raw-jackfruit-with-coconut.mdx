- 1-1/2 cups Jackfruit Raw (Kathal).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kadgi Chakko Recipe, firstly we will cut the raw jackfruit.
1. In order to do that we have to first, grease our hands and the knife that we are going to use, with some oil.
1. This important tip ensures that the hands don't get sticky from the natural fruit latex/sap present in the fruit does not get onto your hands and makes the cutting process hassle-free.
1. Keep a bowl of water mixed with some salt, ready to put the cut raw jackfruit pieces to avoid discolouration of the fruit.
1. Now that your hands and knife are well greased, cut the the jackfruit in half, discard the skin and start making 1 inch pieces and soak them in the salted water.
1. Next place the jackfruit in a pressure cooker with 1/4 cup of water and pressure cook for 2 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Drain any water from the jackfruit and set aside.
1. Gently shred the jackfruit pieces.
1. You do not want to completely mash it or break it.
1. We still want some chunks in the vegetable.
1. In a small saucepan, add oil and heat iti on medium flame, add the coriander seeds and urad dal  until lightly fried and it releases a good aroma.
1. Take care not to burn them; just lightly roasted.
1. Transfer them in a small blender jar along with grated coconut and tamarind.
1. Blend to a very coarse paste.
1. In a deep kadai, heat on oil on medium flame, add the mustard seeds and once it starts to sputter add the curry leaves and fry for a few seconds till crisp.
1. To this add the ground coconut masala and shredded jackfruit, add salt to taste along with jaggery and mix gently.
1. Sprinkle some water and cook till heated through and the jackfruit coconut masala is fairly dry.
1. Keep stirring in between and once it becomes fairly dry, turn off the flame.
1. Serve Kadgi Chakko Recipe along with Steamed Rice, Mooga Ghushi, Solkadhi and Chapati for an everyday meal.
1. For an Indian Diabetic Meal, serve this Kadgi Chakko along with Karnataka Style Ragi Ujju Rotti Recipe and Dal Vangi Recipe and Mooli Raita Recipe for a complete meal.
