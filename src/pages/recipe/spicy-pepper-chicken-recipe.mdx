### Instructions

1. To begin making the Spicy Pepper Chicken recipe, heat kadhai over medium heat and add oil in the kadhai.
1. Once the oil is hot, add chopped onions.
1. Cook them until they become transparent and tender.
1. Add ginger garlic paste to the onion mixture and cook until the raw smell goes off.
1. Now, add chicken pieces to the kadai and give them a stir.
1. You could see the chicken changes its colour as they are getting cooked.
1. To the tender chicken, add turmeric powder, chilli powder and toss them well so that the chicken pieces are coated evenly with the spices.
1. Add a cup of water and cook chicken over the medium flame with lid covered.
1. The secret of the chicken is in the cooking style.
1. Cook in medium flame.
1. So though it is a bit time-consuming, itâ€™s worth every second when you taste the luscious juicy chicken.
1. Meanwhile, heat a heavy bottomed pan and add black peppercorns.
1. Wait till the peppercorn pops out.
1. You will hear popping sound.
1. Add cumin seeds and fennel seeds to the pepper and roast until they become slight brownish.
1. Ensure you switch off the flame and remove them on a right time.
1. Allowing them for a long time on the stove top will burn the cumin and fennel seeds.
1. Cool down the roasted spices and grind them coarsely.
1. Once the water is completely absorbed by the chicken, reduce the flame and add deseeded tomato to the tender cooked chicken.
1. Tomato should be added to the end to prevent them from turning mushy.
1. The pieces should not become mushy but should be tender.
1. Add the grounded masalas to the chicken and combine them well.
1. You could feel the aroma emanating from the chicken in the kadai.
1. Add curry leaves and give them a stir and switch off the flame and garnish with chopped coriander leaves.
1. Serve Spicy Pepper Chicken as part of a meal along with Chettinad Style Poondu Rasam Recipe and Steamed Rice Recipe for a comforting weekday meal.
