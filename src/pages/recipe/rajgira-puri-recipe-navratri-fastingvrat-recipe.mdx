### Ingredients

- 1 Potato (Aloo) - boiled.
- 2 cups Rajgira Flour (Amaranth Flour).
- 1/2 teaspoon Black pepper powder.
- Rock Salt - or salt to taste.
- Sunflower Oil - to fry.

### Instructions

1. We begin making the Rajgira Puri(Navratri Fasting/Vrat Recipe) by mixing all the ingredients into a bowl.
1. THe rajgira flour has less gluten so it might be little difficult to work with.
1. Knead it to a dough which is moist and not very sticky.
1. Make small balls out of the dough and dust the rolling table with rajgira flour and flatten the puris with the rolling pin.
1. See to that you make small thick size round out of the dough.
1. As you have rolled all the dough now, heat a Kadai and add oil.
1. When oil gets heated, gently add a flattened puri.
1. Using a frying spoon or slotted spoon gently press the puri, put some hot oil on top and move in a circular way.
1. You will notice that the puri gets puffed and rises up.
1. At this point, turn it to the other side and fry till it turns golden brown.
1. Do not keep the puri in oil for more than 2 Minutes else it will become brittle.
1. Drain it on kitchen towel.
1. Continue the deep frying process for all the other flattened puris.
1. Serve your soft Rajgira Puri(Navratri Fasting/Vrat Recipe) with Apple Tamatar Ki Subzi or Lauki Paneer Kofta Curry.
