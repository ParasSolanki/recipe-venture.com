### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Ghee.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Ajwain (Carom seeds).
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 teaspoon Whole Black Pepper Corns - coarsely pounded.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the homemade Papdi, we will first have to make the dough.
1. Mix all the flour, ajwain, pepper, oil and salt together.
1. Add water a little at a time and knead the papdi dough until it becomes firm and smooth and firm.
1. It should not be soft.
1. You can make 30 small balls and roll them out thin about 1-1/2 inches in diameter and 1/8 th thickness.
1. Or you can divide the dough into two portions and roll out into a big large circle and cut small rounds using a cookie cutter.
1. Make sure the papdi you roll out are thin.
1. After rolling prick the papdi / kadak puri with a fork all round to prevent it from puffing when bakedPlace the oil for deep frying over medium heat.
1. To check the right temperature, put a small tiny ball of dough into the oil and if it comes sizzling up, then you know the oil is heated to the right temperature.
1. Slide the papdi into the oil in small batches and deep fry until golden brown.
1. Drain the excess oil by placing in a kitchen paper.
1. You can optionally at this stage sprinkle chaat masala on the top to make it chatpata.
1. Allow it to cool and store the Papdi / kadak puri in an airtight container.
1. Use the Papdi to make chaats like Mumbai Style Bhelpuri, Sev Papdi Chaat, and many more.
1. You sure can innovate your topping, may be like a chilli-cheese, or chilli corn and cheese, etc.
