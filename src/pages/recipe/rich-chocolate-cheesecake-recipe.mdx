### Ingredients

- Strawberry Compote - or fresh raspberries to serve.
- 4 Whole Eggs.
- 100 grams Butter - melted.
- 250 grams Bourbon Biscuits - or any other biscuits of your choice.
- 350 grams Mascarpone Cheese.
- 200 grams Caster Sugar.
- 50 grams Butter.
- 2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract.
- 450 grams Dark chocolate - roughly chopped (I use bournville dark chocolate).
- 2 tablespoons Cocoa Powder.
- 650 grams Britannia Cream Cheese - room temperature (I use britannia cream cheese).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rich Chocolate Cheesecake recipe, first preheat the oven to 180 C.
1. Keep all the ingredients ready, so you can proceed to make the cake as explained below.
1. First we will make the biscuit base for the cheesecake.
1. In the food processor, crush the biscuits until it forms crumbs.
1. Add in the butter to the biscuits and blend to combined.
1. Pour the biscuit butter mixture onto the springform pan and press it down evenly.
1. Refrigerate the crust until we make the cheesecake batter.
1. Next we will make the chocolate sauce for the cheesecake using the double boiler method.
1. Place the chocolate in a saucepan and add in the 50 grams of butter.
1. Place the saucepan over another bowl, that has water boiling underneath.
1. This is called the double boiler method.
1. Melt the chocolate over the simmering water until the chocolate is smooth and creamy.
1. Remove from the heat and keep aside to cool.
1. Once the chocolate cools, stir in the cocoa powder and keep aside.
1. If you stir the cocoa when the sauce is hot, the mixture will thicken too quickly and it will become lumpy.
1. Our next step is to make the cheesecake batter.
1. For this place the cream cheese, caster sugar in a large bowl or the bowl of the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and beat until the cream cheese is fluffy.
1. Gradually add in one egg at a time and beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
1. Next beat in the chocolate cocoa sauce into the cheesecake batter.
1. Finally add in the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract and beat until just combined.
1. Pour the chocolate cheesecake batter onto the biscuit base.
1. Wrap the outside of the springform pan with a foil.
1. We do this so that water does not get into the cheesecake while we are baking.
1. Place a roasting tin of the oven, filled with quarter way through with hot water and place it in the middle rack of the oven.
1. This will help the cake steam as well as bake and retain the moisture needed for the cheesecake.
1. Place the springform cake pan on this roasting tin and bake the Chocolate Cheesecake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes.
1. The cake will jiggle a little bit when you remove from the oven.
1. This is the consistency we want for the cake.
1. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and allow it to cool completely.
1. Refrigerate for at least 12 hours before you are ready to serve.
1. To serve the Rich Chocolate Cheesecake , remove the side of the springform pan and cut into wedges of desired size.
1. Top the cheesecake with tart fruits like raspberries or a strawberry compote.
1. Serve this Rich Chocolate Cheesecake as a dessert after a meal of Lemon Coriander Soup Recipe and Schezwan Noodle Sandwich Recipe.
