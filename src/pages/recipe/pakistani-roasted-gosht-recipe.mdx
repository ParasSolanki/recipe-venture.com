1. Once the onions are soft, add washed mutton and mix well.
1. Next add thick curd and salt and let it cook on high flame till the curd starts leaving water from sides.
1. As soon as the water starts appearing from sides, close the lid, simmer the gas and let it cook till mutton is soft and tender.
1. When the mutton is cooked, add coriander powder, turmeric, red chilli powder and mix together.
