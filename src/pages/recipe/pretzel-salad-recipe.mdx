### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Pretzels.
- 1 cup Iceberg lettuce - roughly torn.
- Pecans - Handful.
- 1 tablespoon Lemon juice.
- 1/2 cup Yellow Bell Pepper (Capsicum) - thinly sliced.
- 1/4 teaspoon Black pepper powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Pretzel Salad, we will first make the honey mustard vinaigrette.
1. In a small bowl, whisk together all the ingredients listed in the vinaigrette like the mustard sauce, honey, lemon juice, olive oil,pepper powder and salt to taste, until they are well combined and keep aside.
1. Add all the salad ingredients into a large salad bowl.
1. Pour the dressing over the salad and gently toss the salad with the dressing.
1. Do not add extra salt, since the salted pretzels will balance out the flavours.
1. Garnish with more pecan nuts on top.
1. Note: Add the vinaigrette just before serving the salad, to avoid the salad from getting soggy.
1. Serve Pretzel Salad with Penne Pasta with Veggies in Tomato Base for a weekend lunch or dinner.
