### Instructions

1. To begin making the Thai Spicy Corn and Green Papaya Salad Recipe, we will first grate carrots and papaya.
1. I personally like to use a Food Processor's Grater attachment to grate the raw green papaya and the carrots.
1. The processor simplifies the process of making the salad.
1. To prepare the dressing for the salad, in a pestle and mortar, add the garlic, grated ginger, chillies and lightly pound them.
1. Add the sugar, lemon juice and soy sauce, pound with the pestle and pound again.
1. Add half of the roasted peanuts and lightly pound along with the remaining seasoning ingredients.
1. The next step is to combine all the ingredients for the salad.
1. Into a large salad bowl, add grated papaya, carrot, sliced tomato, the remaining peanuts and steamed corn.
1. Pour dressing over the grated the vegetables and toss them in the dressing.
1. Check the salt, spice and sugar levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Serve the Thai Spicy Corn & Green Papaya Salad as an appetizer for the parties or as a side dish for the main course along with the Thai Curry and steamed rice.
