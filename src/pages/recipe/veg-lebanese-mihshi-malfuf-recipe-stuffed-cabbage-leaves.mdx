1. Spread 1 to 2 table spoons of rice stuffing along the edge of the leaf, then roll it slowly and tightly over the stuffing all the wayLine up the stuffed rolls carefully in a wide/deep cooking pot one by the other in a compact mannerPlace garlic flakes in between.
1. Pour tomato puree and water over the cabbage rolls.
1. Add salt, pepper powder and oil.
1. The sauce should cover the rolls and if not, add more water until it does.
1. Carefully shake/tilt the cooking pot sideways a few times to ensure the sauce seeps through everywherePlace a heavy plate inside the pot, on top of the rolls, cover the pot, and turn on the stove on high heat for about 5-10 minutes till they boil and later simmer and cook for 40 minutes.
