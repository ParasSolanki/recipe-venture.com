### Ingredients

- Sunflower Oil - for deep frying.
- Salt - to taste.
- 2 teaspoon Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- 1/2 cup Jaggery - grated.
- 1 pinch Cooking soda.
- 3 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 4 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 2 cups Kaddu (Parangikai/ Pumpkin) - peeled and finely chopped.
- 2 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin with Pumpkin Wade, pressure cook the pumpkin by adding sufficient water for 3 whistles.
1. Switch off the gas and let it cool down.
1. After the pressure gets released, open the pressure cooker, drain and retain the water.
1. Now in a mixing bowl add the whole wheat flour, boiled pumpkin and other ingredients and mix well.
1. Add 1/ 2 cup water, preferably the water which was used to boil the pumpkin.
1. Knead well to make a soft dough.
1. Ensure that the pumpkin gets nicely mashed while making a dough.
1. Keep the dough covered with a lid or soft muslin cloth for about 20 minutes.
1. After 20 Minutes, apply some oil to your hands and make small balls from the dough.
1. Spread some loose flour on the rolling table and flatten the balls into small circles of approximately 2 inches in diameter.
1. Do not flatten the dough like regular pooris, as the wade will be crispy.
1. Flatten them a bit thicker than that we do for regular pooris.
1. One by one flatten all the balls into small thick pooris and keep them ready on a separate plate.
1. In a kadai or wok, add oil.
1. Let the oil get heated.
1. Now add one flattened wade/poori into the hot oil carefully.
1. Using a frying spoon or slotted spoon gently press the poori, put some hot oil on top and move in a circular way.
1. You will notice that the poori gets puffed and rises up.
1. At this point, turn it to the other side and fry till it turns golden brown.
1. Do not keep the poori in oil for more than 3 minutes else it will become brittle.
1. Drain it on kitchen towel.
1. Continue the deep frying process for all the other flattened pooris.
1. Serve Pumpkin Wade with Sabudana Kheer or you can have it with Masala Chai during your tea time break.
