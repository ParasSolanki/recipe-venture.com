### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 tablespoon Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - chopped finely (optional).
- 1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/4 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1/2 cup Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal).
- Sunflower Oil - to deep fry.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Bihari Chana Dal Puri Recipe, pressure cook chana dal with enough water for about 2 whistles or until cooked enough to get easily mashed.
1. Also do not overcook the dal since it will make the puri mushy.
1. Once chana dal is cool, drain all the water and mash it.
1. It is up to you to mash it completely or leave it grainy.
1. Heat oil in a wide bottomed pan.
1. Add cumin seeds and let it splutter.
1. Then add mashed chana dal and the spice powders and salt.
1. Mix well.
1. Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes.
1. You can add a little coriander leaves too at this stage.
1. Remove the dal from the pan and transfer it to a bowl to cool.
1. Once it cools down, make lemon sized balls and keep aside.
1. Knead whole wheat flour with little salt and water into stiff but soft dough.
1. Cover to let it sit for about 30 minutes.
1. Heat oil in a wide pan for deep frying.
1. Divide the dough into equal sized balls.
1. Flatten one of the ball into 3 to 4 inch diameter circle.
1. Place a ball of spicy chana dal stuffing in the middle.
1. Carefully bring all the edges of the dough to seal the stuffing well.
1. Flatten this into small circles making sure the stuffing does not fall apart.
1. Carefully transfer the flattened puri into hot oil.
1. Flip to let the puri puff on both sides.
1. These stuffed puris will not give a huge puff like unstuffed plain ones, though.
1. Once puris appear brownish and done, transfer them on paper towels to drain excess oil.
1. Repeat the step for all the remaining dough to get puris.
1. Serve this Bihari Chana Dal Puri Recipe hot with any side dish of your choice, like Soya Kheema, Kaale chane ki ghugni, Mooga Gathi or Methi Paneer Bhurji in cream gravy.
1. It can also be served with kheer, traditionally thatâ€™s how it is served.
