### Instructions

1. To begin making Black And Green Grapes Panna Cotta we have to make the green grapes and black grapes panna cotta layers.
1. *For vanilla pannacotta:Take gelatin in a small bowl and soak it in 2 teaspoons of water.
1. Keep aside and let it bloom.
1. Keep your dessert glasses ready.
1. I have used small 120 ml glasses and this recipe makes 4 glasses.
1. Now in a saucepan, add cream and milk.
1. Put it on medium heat.
1. Next, add sugar to the milk cream mixture and mix till sugar gets dissolved.
1. When the mixture starts bubbling at the edges, remove from heat and add soaked gelatin and one teaspoon vanilla essence.
1. Stir it well till gelatin gets dissolved.
1. Now again place the mixture on low heat, and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously.
1. Next, strain the mixture through a fine sieve.
1. Now pour about half an inch layer of this mixture into the dessert glasses and place the glasses in freezer for 30 minutes or until the pannacotta sets.
1. Keep the remaining panna cotta aside for later use.
1. Keep it in a warm place.
1. *For the green grapes layer:Firstly, soak the gelatin in 2 teaspoons of water and keep it aside.
1. Let it bloom.
1. Now, take the green grapes juice in a sauce pan and put it on heat.
1. Add sugar to the juice and stir till sugar gets dissolved.
1. Let the juice boil and then simmer for about 8-10 minutes, then remove from heat and add the soaked gelatin.
1. Stir it till the gelatin gets dissolved.
1. Now again put the juice on low heat and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
1. Now strain it through a fine sieve.
1. Now take out the glasses from the freezer and pour the green juice layer on top of the already set vanilla panna cotta layer.
1. Make sure that the green juice mix has cooled down and is not very hot.
1. Also add few pieces of chopped green grapes to this layer and again place the glasses in the freezer for 20-25 minutes or until the green juice layer gets set.
1. Once the green layer gets set, take out the glasses from the freezer and pour a third layer of the remaining vanilla pannacotta.
1. Place the glasses in freezer for about 30 minutes or until the third layer gets set.
1. *For the black grapes layer:Follow the same steps as mentioned in the green grapes layer recipe.
1. Once the third layer of vanilla pannacotta gets set, remove the glasses from the freezer and pour the final layer of black grapes juice mix.
1. Make sure that the juice mix is not too hot.
1. Also add some pieces of chopped black grapes to this layer and keep the glasses in freezer for 25-30 minutes or until the final layer gets set.
1. When the final layer gets set, remove the glasses from the freezer and keep them in refrigerator for at least an hour.
1. Your layered grapes panna cotta is ready to serve.
1. Don't forget to garnish with some fresh grapes.
