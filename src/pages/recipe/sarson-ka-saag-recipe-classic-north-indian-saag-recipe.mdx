- 1 teaspoon Makki Ka Atta (Yellow Corn Meal Flour).
- 4 cloves Garlic - finely chopped.
- 1/2 teaspoon Garam masala powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Sarson Ka Saag Recipe, we will first steam the leaves together along with a little salt until soft and yet green.
1. For this, you can use a steamer or a pressure cooker.
1. Place all the leaves in the pressure cooker, add a little salt and 3 tablespoons of water.
1. Cover the pressure cooker and cook until you hear one whistle.
1. After the first whistle turn off the heat.
1. Place the cooker under running water and release the pressure immediately and add the Makki ka atta.
1. This process of releasing the pressure immediately will help keep the greens green.
1. Allow it to cool.
1. You can either puree the saag or use a masher and mish mash the greens to make it soft and mushy.
1. The way you like to present it is purely your choice.
1. Heat a teaspoon of ghee in a heavy bottomed pan; add the ginger, garlic, onions and green chillies.
1. Saute all the ingredients together on low heat until the onions are completely tender and soft and lightly browned.
1. You can optionally cover the pan partly to create steam to cook the onions.
1. This process of cooking consumes less oil.
1. Once the onions are well softened, stir in the steamed sarson ka saag, red chilli powder, garam masala powder and coriander powder.
1. Turn the heat to high and give the mixture a quick boil for a couple of minutes, so that the greens get the flavours from the spices and onions.
1. Turn off the heat, check the salt and adjust to taste accordingly.
1. Transfer the Sarson Ka Saag to a serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve the Sarson Ka Saag along with Makki Ki Roti with a dollop of white butter and jaggery and end it with a Masala Chaas.
