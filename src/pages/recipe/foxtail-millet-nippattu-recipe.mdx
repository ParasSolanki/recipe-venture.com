### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Raw Peanuts (Moongphali) - roasted.
- 1/2 cup Dill leaves - finely chopped.
- 1-2 cups Hot water.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Dessicated Coconut.
- 2 teaspoons Dry Red Chillies - finely crushed.
- 1 tablespoon Butter - sizzling hot melted.
- 1 tablespoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 cup Rice flour.
- 1 cup Foxtail Millet flour.
- 1 tablespoon Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- 3 cups Sunflower Oil - to deep fry.
- 1 cup Gram flour (besan).
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).

### Instructions

1. To begin making Foxtail Millet Nippattu, dry roast the flours until they turn aromatic for about 4 to 6 minutes on medium heat.
1. Switch off the heat and cool it completely.
1. Mix all the powders, chili flakes, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, dill leaves and salt together.
1. Pour a tablespoon of sizzling hot melted butter in the mixture and mix thoroughly.
1. Now add lukewarm water little by little and mix into a soft and pliable dough.
1. Make little balls and roll them flat into little discs, about 2 inches in diameter.
1. You can grease a plastic sheet as the surface, or use wax paper to pat down the nippattu.
1. Heat oil in a deep fry pan on medium-high.
1. When the oil starts to smoke, add a tiny ball of dough; if it sizzles and rises to the oil surface, the oil is hot enough.
1. Reduce the heat to medium and gently peel away the nippattu from the wax paper and put them into the oil.
1. They will sink, and foam at first, then come up to the surface quickly.
1. Flip them over to the other side and let them turn into golden brown colour.
1. Drain the savouries on a paper napkin or sieve over a bowl.
1. When the savouries are completely cool, store them in airtight boxes in a cool dark place.
1. Serve Foxtail Millet Nippattu with hot Masala Chai during your tea time break.
