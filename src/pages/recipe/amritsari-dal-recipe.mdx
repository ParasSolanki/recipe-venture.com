1. Once the dal is cooked through for atleast 4 to 5 whistles, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. The next step is to make the masala for the dal.
1. Into a heavy bottomed pan, heat a bit of oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add the onions, ginger, garlic and saute for a few minutes until the onions are tender.
1. Add the chillies, tomatoes and the remaining masalas and saute well until the masalas are well combined into the tomatoes.
1. Add the cooked dal and stir well into the masala.
1. Adjust the consistency of the dal, by adding little water if required.
1. Lightly mash the dal with the back of the spoon to give it a mushy texture.
1. Cover and simmer the dal for about 10 minutes.
1. Once done, stir in the chopped coriander leaves and serve.
1. Serve the Amritsari Dal with Ajwain Puri,and Dubki Wale Aloo Recipe for a lunch meal.
