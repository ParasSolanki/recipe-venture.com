### Instructions

1. To begin making Nutty Pineapple Tutti Frutti Cake Recipe (White Fruitcake), Prepare an 8 inch square or a 9 inch round pan by brushing it with butter or oil and sprinkling 1 tbsp flour over it.
1. You can also use a loaf pan if you want the slices to be big.
1. Preheat oven to 150°C.
1. In a large mixing bowl, add salt and baking powder to the flour (reserving 2 tablespoons) and using a sieve or a strainer, sift the flour mixed with baking powder and salt into another bowl.
1. Put all the fruits and nuts in another bowl and add the remaining 2 tablespoons flour.
1. Mix well.
1. This ensures that all the fruits do not sink to the bottom of the cake.
1. Combine oil/butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat in a hand mixer until smooth and creamy.
1. Add eggs one by one, beating very well after each addition.
1. Add vanilla essence/bean mix and beat again.
1. Now keep the bowls of fruits and flour together.
1. Alternatively fold 2 tablespoons of fruits and 2 tablespoon of the flour into the egg mixture.
1. Fold, using a spatula and mix the ingredients ensuring maximum air is incorporated, following an up and down movement of the spatula.
1. If the mixture is too dry, then add the milk.
1. The mixture should be thick but not stiff.
1. You should be able to spoon it out into the prepared pan.
1. Pour the batter into the pan and thump it on the kitchen countertop to remove any air bubbles.
1. Bake for 90 minutes or 1-1/2 hours at 150°C till a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.
1. Allow the fruit cake to cool for 30 minutes and remove from the pan.
1. Serve Nutty Pineapple Tutti Frutti Cake with piping hot tea made with homemade Chai Ka Masala Recipe and Indian Style Jeera Biscuit Recipe.
