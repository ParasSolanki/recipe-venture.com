### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Lemon juice.
- 1-3/4 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1 teaspoon Baking powder.
- 1/4 cup Fresh orange juice.
- 1/4 cup Raisins.
- 1 cup Sugar.
- 2 cups Carrot (Gajjar) - grated.
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.

### Instructions

1. To prepare Carrot And Orange Loaf Cake Recipe, preheat Oven to 180 degrees C.
1. Very lightly grease or line a 9-inch loaf tin or 2-3 mini loaf tins.
1. In a mixing bowl, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; mix and keep aside.
1. In another large bowl, add eggs and oil and beat well (I used a hand whisk); add the sugar and beat again.
1. Then add the orange zest, orange and lemon juice, raisins, and carrots; mix.
1. Add the flour mix to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.
1. Do not over mix.
1. Pour batter into prepared tins and bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out.
1. Baking time will vary depending on the size of the tins you use.
1. Let the loaf cool in the tin for 10 minutes before turning it out onto a rack to cool.
