- Sunflower Oil - for cooking.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 inch Ginger - grated.
- 1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- 2 Green Chillies - slit.
- 1/2 teaspoon Black pepper powder.
- 1 teaspoon Kalonji (Onion Nigella Seeds).
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- 2 Tomatoes - finely chopped.
- 3 Potatoes (Aloo) - peeled and diced.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Lauki Aloo Sabzi Recipe first get the potatoes and lauki (bottlegourd) peeled and diced.
1. Get the remaining ingredients ready.
1. We will be cooking using a pressure cooker, but you can cook the same vegetable in a heavy bottomed pan if you don't have a pressure cooker.
1. Heat oil in the pressure cooker or the pan on medium heat.
1. Add the nigella seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Add the onions and ginger; saute until the onions become slightly soft.
1. Add all the remaining ingredients along with 1-1/2 cups of water and salt to taste as well.
1. Cover the pressure cooker and cook until you hear couple of whistles.
1. After a couple of whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for about 3 to 4 minutes and turn off the heat.
1.  Allow the pressure to release naturally in the pressure cooker as the vegetables will continue to cook and soften inside while there is pressure.
1. If you were cooking in the pan, cook on low heat until the vegetables get cooked completely and the curry has a gravy like texture.
1. Open the cooker/ pan and give the Aloo Lauki Sabzi a stir.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Serve the Lauki Aloo Sabzi along with Phulkas and a Grated Carrot Salad for a weeknight dinner along with a glass of buttermilk.
