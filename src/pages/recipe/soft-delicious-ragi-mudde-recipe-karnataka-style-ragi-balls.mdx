### Ingredients

- 1 cup Ragi Flour (Finger Millet/ Nagli).
- 2-1/2 cups Hot water.
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.
- Salt - to taste.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Ragi Mudde Recipe, heat 2-1/2 cups of water in a saucepan and add salt to it.
1. Once it starts to boil, reduce the flame and add 3 tablespoons of ragi flour and whisk till there are no lumps formed and it slowly starts to thicken.
1. Now, add the remaining ragi flour spoon by spoon and keep stirring so that there are no lumps.
1. Make sure the heat is on low and ensure you keep stirring until it thickens completely.
1. If you are making a larger quantity, then cover with a lid and leave the ragi aside to cook for about 5 minutes, until you notice it has thickened.
1. Once you notice the ragi has thickened, continue stirring and add 2 tablespoons of ghee and keep stirring until you see the ragi has got a shine on it.
1. It takes a good 10 minutes to make ragi mudde from 1 cup of ragi flour.
1. Give the ragi mudde a taste and it should not feel raw.
1. In order to shape ragi mudde to balls, grease a bowl with oil or ghee.
1. Place 2 large tablespoons of ragi mudde and start twirling it around till it forms a nice smooth ball.
1. Once done, the ragi mudde can be served hot.
1. Note that the ragi mudde needs to be shaped into a ball while it is hot.
1. Using a small bowl, helps in shaping the ragi mudde.
1. Serve the Ragi Mudde Recipe along with Chicken Saaru, or Huli Soppu Saaru Recipe and Sabbasige palya to enjoy your lunch.
1. The Ragi Mudde Recipe can also be served for an Indian Diabetic Lunch or dinner along with a Sabbasige palya and Raita.
