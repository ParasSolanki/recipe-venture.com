### Ingredients

- Salt - salt.
- 1/4 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera) - (8 months and above).

- 1/4 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi) - (8 months and above).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Creamy Beetroot and Potato Baby Puree Recipe, we will first wash the vegetables well in water.
1. Peel the skin and cut the vegetables into dices.
1. Place the beetroot and potatoes into the pressure cooker, add 3 to 4 tablespoons of water and pressure cook the vegetables until you hear a couple of whistles.
1. After a couple of whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for couple of minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally in the cooker.
1. Once done, open the cooker and place the beet and potatoes in a mixer grinder and puree into a paste that is desired.
1. If your baby is very small, as young as 6 months, and is able to handle textures, then make a slightly coarse puree.
1. Adjust the consistency of the creamy beet and potato puree by adding water.
1. Add a pinch of salt and the puree will be ready to be served to your baby.
1. If your baby is 8 months and older, then you can add turmeric powder and cumin powder into the vegetable.
1. It adds to taste and your baby will enjoy it too.
1. Additionally, a great way to serve it is along with a bowl of plain yogurt for your baby older than 8 months.
1. Children love vegetables and plain yogurt and helps in easy digestion for the baby.
