### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Sugar - powdered.
- 1 cup Cashew nuts.
- 2 tablespoons Milk Powder.
- 1 teaspoon Rose water.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2 teaspoon Ghee.
- 1 cup Pistachios.
- 3/4 cup Condensed Milk - sweetened.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kaju Pista Roll Recipe (Cashew Nut Pistachio Fudge), first grind the cashews and pistachios separately into fine powder.
1. In a thick n heavy bottomed pan add the ghee, condensed milk and powdered cashews.
1. Stir well to combine.
1. Add milk powder, rose water & start cooking this mixture on a medium heat until it starts to leave the sides of the pan & forms soft dough.
1. Keep stirring continuously to avoid any burning at the bottom of the pan.
1. This might take 10 to 12 minutes.
1. Now turn off the heat and transfer this on to a plate to cool.
1. Meanwhile in a bowl take the powdered pistachios and combined it along with powdered sugar, cardamom powder and make it into a soft dough by adding little water at a time.
1. Knead to make a soft dough, just enough for it to come together.
1. Try not to over knead, as it will get softer and will release oils.
1. The final step to make the Kaju Pista Roll is to shape it.
1. Take a rolling board and spread a parchment over it.
1. Place the kaju dough over the parchment paper and place another parchment paper over it.
1. Using a rolling pin roll the kaju into a rectangular sheet.
1. Remove the parchment paper covering the kaju and spread the pista mixture over the rolled kaju.
1. Cut the whole sheet into 2 inch wide strips enough to make a Kaju pista roll.
1. Roll each strip into a log.
1. Proceed the same way to make the kaju pista rolls.
