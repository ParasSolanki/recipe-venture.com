### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chicken Kappa Biryani Recipe, we will first pressure cook the tapioca in pressure cooker with salt to 6 whistles.
1. The tapioca must be boiled enough so that it is easy for you to mash it.
1.  Once done allow the pressure cooker to release the pressure naturally.
1. Drain the water, transfer the tapioca in a bowl and mash it well, leaving it a bit chunky as well.
1. Set aside.
1. Heat a kadai with coconut oil, add curry leaves and allow it splutter.
1. Add ginger, garlic and saute for a few minutes.
1. Add sliced onions and saute till they turn translucent.
1. Now add all the spice powders-  turmeric powder, red chilli powder, garam masala powder and pepper powder, give it a good stir.
1. Add minced chicken and cook until the chicken is done.
1. This will take about 18-20 minutes.
1. Add the cooked and mashed tapioca, mix them well.
1. By using a masher try to mash the tapioca a little more and also keep few chunks as well for a good texture.
1. Serve the Chicken Kappa Biryani Recipe along with potato theeyal or Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita to enjoy your Sunday lunch.
