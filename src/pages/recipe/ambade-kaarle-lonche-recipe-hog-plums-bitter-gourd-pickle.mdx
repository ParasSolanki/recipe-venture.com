### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 4 Green Chillies.
- 1/4 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 1 Karela (Bitter Gourd/ Pavakkai).
- 6 tablespoons Jaggery.
- 6 Hog Plum (Amtekai).
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1/4 teaspoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).
- 1/4 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 2 pinch Asafoetida (hing).

### Instructions

1. To begin making Ambade Kaarle Lonche Recipe, scrape the outer layer of bitter gourd well, clean the seeds if they are not tender.
1. Chop each bitter gourd lengthwise to 2 inch long strips, apply some salt (I used 1/4 teaspoon) and keep it away for an hour to reduce the bitterness.
1. After an hour, squeeze away excess water from the bitter gourds after washing them.
1. This will remove most of the bitterness the gourd has.
1. Stir fry these drained bitter gourds in a kadai with a bit of oil till softened.
1. Keep aside.
1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan/kadhai, add mustard seeds and allow them to splutter.
1. Once spluttered, immediately add all the ingredients under tempering - fenugreek, green chillies, Irani hing and saute a bit.
1. Stir on low heat, add turmeric powder, ambade- hog plums and mix well.
1. Take care that the tempering is right and not any burnt.
1. Add enough water to cook ambade (I added 4 tablespoons) and on medium heat, bring to boil.
1. Reduce heat when it starts boiling.
1. Cover and cook till the ambade / hog plum are cooked.
1. Now add the stir fried bitter gourd strips, jaggery and salt and cook till jaggery melts.
1. Now add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water as per requirement, else the jaggery will stiffen when cooled.
1. Transfer to a jar after it is cooled to room temperature.
1. Serve Ambade Kaarle Lonche Recipe as an accompaniment with a meal of Steamed Rice, Karwar Style Muga Ambat Recipe, and Puri Recipe (Puffed Fried Indian Bread).
