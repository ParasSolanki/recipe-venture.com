1. Take a sauce pan, cook the mangoes with sufficient water, until they are soft and cooked thoroughly on a medium high heat.
1. When the color of the mango peel appears soft, you know they are cooked.
1. It might take 10 minutes depending on the heat.
1. Switch off once done and drain water into a bowl (reserve for later) and keep the whole mangoes in the pan and allow the mangoes to cool till handleable.
1. You can also keep the saucepan in a plate filled with cold water to fasten this process.
1. Once the mangoes cool, peel them.
1. You will be able to peel the mangoes easily using your fingers.
1. Put the mango peels into the bowl with the reserved water and extract any more remaining pulp by squeezing with hand.
1. Discard peel once done and reserve the water as you do.
1. Now squeeze cooked mangoes with hands to make the curry pulpy, using a masher is difficult with fibrous pulp on the seed of mango.
1. Do not discard the stone within, since the fibrous pulp attached to the stone is slurpy to try, while having the curry and you will love this experience for sure.
1. Keep saucepan back on a medium heat, add crushed green chilli, salt and jaggery to the pan with mango pulp and seed/stone and mix well.
1. Adjust taste and consistency of the Kaad Manga Curry Recipe by adding water if required.
1. Let it simmer for a few minutes and switch off heat.
1. In a tadka pan, heat a little coconut oil and splutter mustard seeds.
1. Once the mustard seeds splutter, add hing, broken red chilli and curry leaves.
1. Turn off the heat after the curry leaves crackle.
1. Pour the tadka on Kaad Manga Curry Recipe and give it a quick stir.
1. Close the lid of the pan and allow the Kaad Manga Curry to sit for about 10 minutes before serving.
