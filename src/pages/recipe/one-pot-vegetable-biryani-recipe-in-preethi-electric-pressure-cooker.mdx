### Instructions

1. To begin making the One Pot Pressure Cooker Vegetable Biryani Recipe, first grind the onion, garlic, ginger, green chili into a paste using the Zodiac Mixer Grinder .
1. The small jar is my favorite, it really helps when you have to make a small quantity of biryani masala paste.
1. The next step to make the one pot vegetable biryani is to cook the biryani directly in the electric pressure cooker.
1. Set the mode to gravy mode and we will cook the masala for the biryani.
1. Note, is you don't have the electric pressure cooker, you can also make the pressure cooker biryani recipe using a regular pressure cooker and it will work just as fine.
1. Add the oil and the ginger garlic paste.
1. Saute the ginger garlic paste, until the raw smell goes away.
1. Add the spices - cloves, cinnamon stick, bay leaves and cardamom and the spice powders.
1. Saute the spices in the biryani onion masala.
1. Add the tomato puree, 1-1/2 cups water, rice, salt and mint leaves.
1. Lock the lid of the electric pressure cooker in place.
1. Change the setting in the biryani mode and allow the timer to set itself and wait until it turns to keep warm mode.
1. If you are using a regular pressure cooker, then simple close the pressure cooker and cook for 3 to 4 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the one pot vegetable biryani comes to keep warm mode, allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once done, stir the vegetable biryani gently and transfer to a bowl and serve.
1. Serve the One Pot Vegetable Biryani Recipe along with Hyderabadi Bagara Baingan or Hyderabadi Mirchi ka salan and raita for a one dish dinner or lunch.
