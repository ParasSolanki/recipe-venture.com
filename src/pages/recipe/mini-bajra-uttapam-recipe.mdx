### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mini Bajra Uttapam Recipe, we will first make the batter.
1. *To make the Bajra Uttapam Batter:Firstly, wash the urad dal and methi seeds together and soak it together in a bowl, immersed in water.
1. Next combine the idli rice and bajra seeds, wash them well and soak them in a bowl, immersed in water.
1. Keep them all soaked for about 6 hours.
1. Next, add the soaked and drained urad dal and methi seeds, into a mixer jar along with some water and grind to make a smooth batter.
1. Transfer the urad dal batter to a large bowl and set aside.
1. Add the soaked and drained rice and bajra mixture into the mixer jar along with some water and grind it to make a smooth batter.
1. Combine this idli-bajra batter, along with the urad dal batter and mix well.
1. To this bajra uttapam batter add salt, mix well to combine, and allow it to ferment overnight.
1. Once it has fermented overnight it, you can make Idli the first day and even dosa and uttapams with this batter.
1. The next step is to make the topping for the Bajra uttapam:In a mixing bowl, combine the onions, capsicum, green chilli, mint leaves salt and cumin powder and mix well.
1. Preheat a tawa on medium-high heat; once hot, gently spread 1 ladleful of the bajra uttapam batter, in a circular motion, ensuring the uthappam is thick like a pancake.
1. Spread a tablespoon of the onion-capsicum topping over the mini Bajra Uttapam and lightly press, embedding it onto the uttapam.
1. Drizzle a little ghee around the Uttapam and after a couple of minutes, flip the bajra uttapam, to cook on the other side.
1. Once you've achieved a lovely golden brown colour on both sides, remove the Bajra Uttapam from the tawa and serve.
1. Similarly make the Bajra Uttapam using the rest of the batter.
1. You can store this batter in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about 4 days.
1. Serve Mini Bajra Uttapam Recipe along with Raw Mango Coconut Chutney Recipe, Idli Dosa Milagai Podi Recipe and finish with a cup of Kumbakonam Filter Coffee Recipe for a lip smacking breakfast.
