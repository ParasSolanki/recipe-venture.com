### Ingredients

- 500 ml Milk.
- 3 tablespoons Cashew nuts - halved.
- 3 tablespoons Raisins.
- 2 Saffron strands.
- 1 cup Water.
- 1/2 cup Semiya (Vermicelli) - roasted.
- 1 tablespoon Ghee.
- 1/4 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1/2 cup Sugar.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Semiya Payasam Recipe, cook the Semiya (Vermicelli) in water.
1. Into a saucepan, add the water and the semiya and bring to a boil.
1. Once the semiya begins to boil, turn the heat to medium and cook the semiya until it is soft and done.
1. Once done, add the 500 ml of milk, sugar, cardamom powder and saffron and stir until the sugar dissolves completely.
1. Simmer the Semiya Payasam/ kheer for another 5 minutes till the flavors are  absorbed well and the payasam looks thick and creamy.
1.  You can adjust the consistency of the payasam, based on your preference.
1. Note, that once the Semiya Payasam cools down, the semiya will begin to absorb all the milk and get thicker as well.
1. While the Semiya is simmering, we will roast the cashew nuts.
1. In a small pan, heat ghee on low heat; add in the cashew nuts and roast until crisp and golden.
1. Add in the raisins, stir for a few seconds until it puffs up and keep aside.
1. Turn off the heat and finally garnish the Semiya Payasam with the roasted cashew nuts and raisins and serve the payasam hot or cold as desired.
1. Serve the Semiya Payasam/ Seviyan Kheer as a party dessert for any festive occasion or after your meal of Jodhpuri Aloo, Ajwain Puri, Satvik Carrot Sprout Salad and Mirchi Ka Chunda.
