### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Baking powder.
- 170 grams Vivatta Maida.
- 1/2 cup Dates - paste or any filling of your choice.
- 150 grams Butter.
- Salt - a pinch.
- 3/4 cup Sugar - powdered sugar for coating the cookies.
- 2 tablespoons Sesame seeds (Til seeds).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Snow Drop Cookies recipe, firstly pre heat the oven at 275 degree celcius for 15 minutes.
1. Beat the butter untill it is smooth and a little pale in colour.
1. Next add the sesame seeds and mix it well.
1. Sift the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt together in batches untill it forms a soft dough.
1. You may need more or less flour according to the type of flour you use.
1. It should not stick to your hands and should not crack when formed into a ball.
1. If you want to add filling then take a small ball size of the dough and flatten them a bit with your fingers on your palm then take a small pea sized fiiling of your desire and place it in the center then bring the ends together and form a ball.
1. (its the same process as making a kachori)In a baking sheet place small balls of cookies but do not flatten them with your hands Bake it at 200 degree celcius for about 30 minutes, keep a close eye to the cookies while its baking as we do not need to brown the cookies from top, which makes them melt in your mouth.
1. Take out the cookies once baked and nicely browned from bottom and let them cool down a little in the sheet itself.
1. Do not try to touch them at this point as they are likey to break.
1. Once the cookies are cooled down but slightly warm sprinkle powdered sugar on top of them with the help of a sieve.
1. Do not dip them directly in the sugar as they are very soft and likely to break.
1. The sugar will slightly melt after sometime then do a second round of sprinkling sugar, be generous in coating them with sugar as we do not have any sugar in the cookies itself.
1. Store them in an air tight container or serve it immediately.
1. Serve Snow Drop Cookies along with Espresso Coffee for your tea time break.
1. You can also pack these cookies for your kids snacks box.
