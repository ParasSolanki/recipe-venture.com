### Ingredients

- 2 sprig Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - finely chopped.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 16 Whole Wheat Brown Bread.
- 2 Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- 3 Tomatoes - chopped small.
- 1 teaspoon Sambar Powder.
- 3 sprig Curry leaves.
- 1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 2 Onions - thinly sliced.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the bread upma recipe, we will first toast the bread.
1. You can toast it in your toaster or on a skillet.
1. Once the bread is toasted, apply the softened butter over the toasted bread.
1. Next cut the bread into small dices and keep aside.
1. In a large wok or a kadai, heat 1 tablespoon of oil on medium heat and add in the mustard seeds.
1. Allow the mustard seeds to crackle and add in the onions and green chillies.
1. Saute the onions on medium heat, until soft and tender.
1. Once the onions are soft, add in the tomatoes, curry leaves, turmeric powder and sambar powder.
1. Stir and cook the tomatoes until they turn lightly soft as well.
1. Finally add in the salt and the toasted buttered bread pieces.
1. Stir well to combine all the ingredients and stir fry on medium to high heat for a couple of minutes.
1. We stir fry just to make sure the bread pieces have got all the spices and salted well.
1. Check salt levels.
1. Remember the butter you used could have some salt as well.
1. Stir in the chopped coriander leaves into the bread upma to get the delicious fresh flavour.
