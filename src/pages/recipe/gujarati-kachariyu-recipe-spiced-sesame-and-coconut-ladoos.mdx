### Instructions

1. To begin making Gujarati Kachariyu Recipe, first we will prepare the filling.
1. Place a skillet or kadai on the heat.
1. Add ghee, once melted add chopped dates and figs to it.
1. Cook this, stirring sometimes, till they turn mushy and stewed, and start leaving sides of pan to come together as a ball.
1. Turn the heat off and set the pan aside to cool.
1. Once cool make small marble sized balls of the mix and set aside.
1. To prepare the rest of the Kachariyu, in a pan or kadai lightly toast sesame seeds, coconut, almonds and melon seeds.
1. While it is still warm transfer the mixture to a grinder add jaggery and grind finely.
1. To this, add the dried ginger powder, cardamom powder and nutmeg powder.
1. Pulse it again a couple of times till it mixes well.
1. You will notice that the sesame seeds and coconut has released its oil and the mixture gets crumbly.
1. If held in a fist the mixture should come together lightly.
1. If this does not happen pulse it a few more times.
1. Put a spoonful of Kachariyu mixture in the well of your palm, lightly press it and place the filling in the center and bring the Kachariyu together to form a small ladoo.
1. Repeat till you have formed all the ladoos.
1. You can roll them in desiccated coconut or finely chopped almonds for garnish too.
1. Store the Kachariyu in an airtight box and serve them as a festive ladoo on any occasion or enjoy them as a mid-morning pick-me-up, or snack box treat.
1. Serve Gujarati Kachariyu as a snack along with your morning or evening cup of Masala Chai.
