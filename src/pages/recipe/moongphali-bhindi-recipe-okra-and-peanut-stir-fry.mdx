### Ingredients

- 4 Dry Red Chillies.
- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 2 teaspoons Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 4 tablespoons Sunflower Oil.
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- 500 grams Bhindi (Lady Finger/Okra).
- 1 cup Roasted Peanuts (Moongphali) - coarsely ground.
- 1 teaspoon Amchur (Dry Mango Powder).

### Instructions

1. To make Moongphali Bhindi Recipe, first wash and pat dry okra.
1. Cut okra into half lengthwise removing the stems.
1. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat.
1. Once the oil is heated, add the dry red chilies and chopped onions.
1. Saute the onion over medium heat till they turn golden brown in color.
1. Now add the chopped okra along with ground peanuts, coriander powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt.
1. Stir to combine all the ingredients well.
1. Cover the pan with a lid and cook the vegetable over the low heat till it is cooked and tender.
1. Once the Bhindi is half way through the cooking process, open the lid and give it a gentle stir.
1. Place a long ladle in the Kadai and partially cover the pan and cook the bhindi until completely done.
1.  We keep a ladle in the Kadai so that, the pan can be slightly ajar and this will help some of the moisture escape and preventing the bhindi to become soggy and mushy.
1. After few minutes remove the lid and check Moongphali Bhindi for doneness.
1. Add dry mango powder, stir to combine and cook for another minute or so.
1. Check the salt and spice levels, adjust to suit your taste and turn off the heat.
1. Transfer Moongphali Bhindi to a serving bowl and serve for a weeknight dinner or lunch Tawa Paratha or Phulka.
1. You can also pack this bhindi for your work lunch or kids lunch box.
