### Instructions

1. To begin making Shimla Mirchi Panchamrut Recipe, first prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. The first step is to make the masala.
1. Heat a small pan over medium heat; add the cloves, cinnamon, black pepper, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, methi seeds and roast for a minute until the aromas of the spices come through.
1. Once roasted, add the grated coconut and roast for a minute more and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the mixture to cool a bit.
1. Add the roasted masala into a small jar of the mixer grinder along with the peanuts and tamarind.
1. Blend to make a powder without adding any water.
1. This fresh masala will go over the cooked capsicum mixture.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Into a pressure cooked, add the raw peanuts along with 1/4 cup of water and pressure cook for 2 whistles.
1. After 2 whistles turn the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once released, open the cooker and keep the cooked peanuts aside.
1. Heat coconut oil in a pan; add the mustard seeds and methi seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Once it crackles, add the asafoetida and give it a stir.
1. Next add the cashew nuts and capsicum and sprinkle a little salt and turmeric powder.
1. Give the mixture a stir.
1. Cover the pan and cook the capsicum until it is just about cooked.
1. Take care not to overcook the capsicum and ensure it has a firm texture and is also cooked with a good bite.
1. Once the capsicum has reached that stage, stir in the freshly roasted and ground masala, jaggery and the cooked peanuts into the cashew and capsicum mixture.
1. Give it a stir until all the ingredients are well combined.
1. Check the taste and add more salt if required and stir.
1. Cover the pan and simmer the Shimla Mirchi Panchamrut for another 3 to 4 minutes so the masalas get well absorbed making the sabzi flavourful and tasty.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and transfer the Shimla Mirchi Panchamrut to a serving bowl and serve hot.
