### Instructions

1. To begin making the Spicy Vegetable Pulav with Coconut Milk, we will first wash the rice under water and keep it aside.
1. Keep the coconut milk, vegetable chopped and the spices ready by the side.
1. We will be making the pulav in one pot and cooking it in a Pressure Cooker.
1. If you dont have a pressure cooker, then you can proceed with the same intructions and cook in a Sauce Pan.
1. Pound the ginger and garlic in a pestle and mortar and keep aside.
1. Into the pressure cooker or the sauce pan, add in the a teaspoon of oil and add in the ginger garlic paste.
1. Saute for a few seconds and add in the cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and bay leaf.
1. Next add in the vegetables, green chillies, rice, turmeric powder, salt and coconut milk.
1. Add an additional cup of water and stir all the ingredients and cover the pressure cooker (saucepan).
1. *Method Sauce Pan:Turn the heat to high and allow the pulao mixture to come to a boil.
1. Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer the rice until the pulao absorbs all the water.
1. Once all the water is absorbed turn off the heat and allow the pulao to rest for at least 10 minutes, this will help the rice to become a little stiff and remain as grains.
1. *Method Pressure Cooker:Turn the heat to high, place the weight on cook on high until you hear a couple of whistles.
1. After a couple of whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for about 3 minutes and then turn off the heat.
1.  Allow the pressure to release naturally as the the rice will continue to cook in the pressure cooker.
1.  Once the pressure is released you can open the cooker and proceed to the next steps.
