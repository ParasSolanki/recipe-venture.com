### Instructions

1. To begin making the Karuveppilai Kuzhambu Recipe, we will first make the ground masala by roasting its ingredients.
1. Heat a skillet on medium heat; add the fenugreek seeds, urad dal, red chillies and coriander seeds.
1. Roast them on medium heat until you can smell the roasted aroma and they are lightly browned.
1. Turn off the heat.
1. In a mixer grinder grind the roasted ingredients along with the coconut and curry leaves into a coarse and yet smooth paste.
1. You can add a little water if required for it to grind well.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Heat a large sauce pan on medium heat; add a teaspoon of sesame oil and the quartered onions.
1. Saute the onions until they turn lightly golden and have a sweet smelling aroma.
1. This will take about 4 to 5 minutes on medium heat.
1. Once the onions are cooked, add the tamarind water, turmeric powder and salt.
1. Bring the mixture to a brisk boil for about 4 to 5 minutes.
1. After about 4 minutes, add the Karuveppilai (curry leaf) masala into the onion tamarind water.
1. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Simmer the Karuveppilai Kuzhambu for about 3 to 4 minutes, turn off the heat and transfer to a serving bowl.
1. The final step is the seasoning for the Kuzhambu.
1. Heat a small tadka pan on medium heat; add the mustard seeds and the urad dal.
1. Allow it to crackle and roast a little until browned.
1. Add the curry leaves and turn off the heat.
1. Pour this seasoning over the Kuzhambu and serve warm.
