### Instructions

1. To begin making the Russian Pattice Recipe, we will first par boil the chicken.
1. Heat water in a saucepan on high heat along with some salt and give it a brisk boil, add the chicken breast to it and cook it for about 3-5 minutes.
1. Turn off the flame, drain the excess water and shred the chicken into small pieces.
1. Transfer to a bowl.
1. Along with the chicken in the bowl, add mashed potatoes, cheese, garlic, ginger, green chillies, coriander leaves, bread crumbs, salt, black pepper powder, garam masala powder, mix well and bring the mixture together.
1. Divide the Russian pattice mixture into equal portions.
1. Roll each portion between your palms and flatten it to resemble like a disc.
1. Preheat a kadai, with oil on medium-highh heat.
1. Alternatively, if you wish to, you could also shallow fry it.
1. In a small bowl, break the egg and whisk it well.
1. In yet another bowl, mix together the rava and the bread crumbs and set aside.
1. Dip each pattice into the egg then roll it into the rava-bread crumb mixture.
1. Drop these Russian pattice into the hot oil and fry until it turns into a lovely golden brown colour.
1. Serve hot Russian Pattice.
1. Serve Russian Pattice as a tea time snack or along with a Parsi meal along with Green Chutney or Tomato Ketchup.
