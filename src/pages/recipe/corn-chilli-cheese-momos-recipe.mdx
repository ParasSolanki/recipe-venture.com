1. Now add the sweet corn, black pepper powder, red chili flakes salt to taste and stir well until combined.
1. Once done turn off the heat and allow it to cool.
1. Now we will proceed to make the Chilli Cheese MomosKnead the dough once again and divide the dough into small balls.
1. Dust in a little flour and roll each ball into small circles.
1. Place about 1 teaspoon of the corn filling and add about 1 tablespoon of the grated britannia cheezza into the center.

1. While you are shaping the momos, keep a steamer with water boiling.
1. Grease the steamer pan with some oil to prevent the momos from sticking.
1. Place the shaped Corn Chilli Cheese Momos on the greased steamer pan.
