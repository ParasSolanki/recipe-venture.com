1. Now take out the hot mold and immediately immerse it in the flour batter.
1. Make sure the mold is only 3/4 immersed in batter, to ease the cookies to to transferred to oil when they are being fried.
1. Now again dip the batter coated on the mold in hot oil completely and hold on for a minute or two, till the batter gets golden and crispy.
