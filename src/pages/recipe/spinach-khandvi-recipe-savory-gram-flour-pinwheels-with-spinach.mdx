### Ingredients

- 1 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).
- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1/2 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 1 teaspoon Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- 2 tablespoons Fresh coconut - grated.
- 2 teaspoons Sunflower Oil.
- Salt - to taste.
- 100 grams Spinach Leaves (Palak) - roughly chopped.
- 2 tablespoons Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - chopped.
- 1 cup Gram flour (besan).
- 1-1/4 cups Water.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 1/4 teaspoon Sugar.
- 6 Curry leaves.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Spinach Khandvi Recipe, into a blender combine the besan, curd, spinach leaves, turmeric powder, asafoetida powder,  sugar, salt  and blitz it once, once it has all come together.
1. Open the mixer jar add about a cup of water and blitz the mixture once again.
1. When you blend, add the water little at a time, so we get a finely pureed spinach mixture.
1. Before we proceed to the next step, we need to prepare the work surface to make Khandvi.
1. It is important to have a smooth surface and the ideal is granite counter top.
1. Clean the counter top thoroughly as you will be spreading the cooked gram flour mixture.
1. If you don't have a granite counter top, then you can use a flat plate or a smooth cookie sheet big enough to spread the mixture.
1. If you do it on plates, or cookie sheets, you will probably have to spread the mixture in multiple rounds.
1. The number of these plates you need will depend on how thin you spread the mixture.
1. My estimate is about 3-4 plates of 12 inch diameter.
1. Also if you use plates or cookie sheets, spread them on the back side.
1. Transfer the khandvi batter into a non-stick pan and heat on low to medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent lump formation.
1. Continue stirring on low heat, till the mixture thickens for 15 minutes.
1. The mixture will begin to attain a shine.
1. Once you notice the Khandvi batter has a shine to it and has thickened, turn off the heat.
1. Keep the mixture covered, so it remains hot while you proceed to the steps below, as it will not spread when it cools down.
1. Spread the hot mixture on the prepared surface as thinly as possible, with a flat spatula.
1. When you have finished spreading the batter, allow it to cool a little and settle down about three minutes and not less.
1. Repeat this process and continue to spread the entire mixture, before it cools down.
1. After about 10 minutes have passed begin rolling the mixture into a log starting from the top.
1. Once the rolls have been made, cut the rolls into one inch size logs.
1. Place the cut rolls on a serving platter.
1. Heat oil in a pan for seasoning; add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, curry leaves allow them to crackle.
1. Sprinkle the seasoning over the rolls and garnish with coriander leaves and coconut.
1. This can be made one day ahead and kept in the refrigerator and warmed up in the microwave before serving.
1. Serve Spinach Khandvi as a side dish along with Gujarati Dal, Aloo Bhindi and Hot Phulkas for your weekday lunch.
