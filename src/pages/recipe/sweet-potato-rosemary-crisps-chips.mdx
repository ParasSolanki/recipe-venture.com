### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Lemon juice.
- 2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- 1 teaspoon Rosemary - crushed.
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.
- 1 Sweet Potato.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Sweet Potato Rosemary Crips/ Chip Recipe, we will first have to slice the sweet potatoes into paper thin slices using a mandolin or a sharp knife.
1. Place the slices in a large bowl and add in the remaining ingredients into the bowl.
1. Stir well so that the potato gets well coated with the herbs, lemon, salt and olive oil.
1. Lay the slices of herbed potatoes on the dehydrator tray without overlapping.
1. Dehydrate 6 to 10 hours 125 C.
1. Once the chips are dehydrated, cool the chips completely and store them in air tight containers for several weeks.
1. By dehydrating your own chips, the chips retain all the nutrition and you can eat snacks guilt free at home any time.
1. Serve Sweet Potato & Rosemary Crisps/Chips as a party appetizer along with a party meal of Insalata Caprese Salad, Spaghetti Pasta In Green Olive Pesto Sauce and Quick & Easy Creamy Fruit Trifle .
