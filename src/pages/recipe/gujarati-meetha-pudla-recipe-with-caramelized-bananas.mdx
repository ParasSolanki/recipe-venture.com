1. To prepare Gujarati Meetha Pudla Recipe, in a mixing bowl, soak jaggery in water for few minutes to be dissolved.

1. Spoon the pudla batter and make mini pancakes with the pudla batter.
1. Allow the meetha pudla to look on medium heat and you will notice the top of the pudla getting cooked.
1.  Once the top is cooked, flip over and cook on the other side until golden brown.
1. To make the stuffing, heat a skillet and met the Nutralite classic and jaggery.
1. Once melted, add the bananas and the cardamom powder.
1. Gently caramelize the bananas in the jaggery until it gets well coated and sticky.
1. Once done, turn off the heat.
1. In another small pan, melt a little Nutralite Classic again, add the cashew nuts and roast on medium heat until light browned and crisp.
1. Place these mini meetha pudla on a serving platter, spoon the caramelized bananas with jaggery, sprinkle some coconut and top it with roasted cashew nuts and serve the Meetha Pudla as a sweet for parties and festivals.
