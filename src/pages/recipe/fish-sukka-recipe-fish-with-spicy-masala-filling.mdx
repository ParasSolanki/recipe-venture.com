### Instructions

1. To begin making the Fish Sukka Recipe (Fish With Spicy Masala Filling), cut the fish into thin slices.
1. Keep only the flesh of the fish and discard bones and organs.
1. Wash well and apply some salt.
1. (I haven't used the heads, but you can use them if you wish)Marinate fish with red chilli powder, turmeric powder, ginger garlic paste and lime juice, in a big bowl.
1. Mix and keep aside for 10 minutes.
1. Till the fish gets marinated, let us prepare the sukka gravy.
1. In a shallow fry pan, dry roast all the spices mentioned including coriander seeds, cloves, whole black peppercorns, black cardamom, cinnamon stick except poppy seeds.
1. Roast them on medium heat until fragrant.
1. Make some room in the center of the pan by pushing the roasted spices aside.
1. Add poppy seeds in the center and roast till they change color slightly.
1. Switch off and let cool.
1. Add the roasted spices along with desiccated coconut in a mixer grinder.
1. Add a tablespoon of red chilli powder and using very little water ( I used 1/4th cup) grind it to a smooth paste.
1. Keep aside.
1. Heat a tablespoon oil in a kadai and add slit green chilies and chopped onion.
1. Fry on medium high heat till onion changes its colour to light brown.
1. Pour in the prepared coconut paste and saute it for 5-6 minutes or till the sukka gravy is dried.
1. Add some salt and half of the chopped coriander leaves.
1. Mix well and stir in the marinated fish .
1. If the gravy is too dry, add one or two tablespoons of water.
1. Add a teaspoon of lime juice.
1. Cover and let it cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes.
1. Check in between.
1. Do not mix fish too much, because unlike chicken, fish tend to break easily, releasing fish bones inside the dish.
1. Gently stir in between or you can just shake the kadai in order for fish to get mixed up well with the gravy.
1. Check if the fish is done with a toothpick.
1. Sprinkle the remaining chopped coriander leaves and remove from  heat.
1. Fish Sukka Recipe is served as an appetizer with Lahsuni Dal Tadka (Moong Dal with Pumpkin) and steamed rice or Phulka, or Yakhni Pulao With Chicken Recipe and Masala Chaas Recipe (Indian Spiced Buttermilk) for a complete meal.
