### Ingredients

- Water - as required.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 3 cloves Garlic.
- 1 cup Cauliflower (gobi) - shredded.
- 2 cups Green peas (Matar) - peeled.
- Sunflower Oil - as required.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Matar Gobi Paratha recipe, we need to prepare the dough for parathas so combine whole wheat flour, water and 2 teaspoons of oil and knead it properly.
1. Once the dough is ready, keep it covered with a wet kitchen towel.
1. Next, take the peas and use a mixer to turn them into a thick paste.
1. If it becomes too thick then you can add a little bit of water.
1. Wash the cauliflower thoroughly and grate it using a grater.
1. Now heat up some oil in a heavy bottomed pan and add the cumin seeds.
1. Once the seeds start spluttering then add chopped garlic cloves.
1. Let it cook for a couple of seconds and then add mashed peas, grated cauliflower, red chilli powder and salt.
1. Mix everything well and cook on low heat for 10 to 15 minutes but make sure it is not getting burned.
1. Both gobi and matar should become dry and not mushy.
1. If the stuffing is mushy, you will not be able to roll the parathas easily.
1. Once the matar and gobi stuffing is ready then let it cool down a bit.
1. Once the stuffing has cooled down, we will make the parathas.
1. Take a lemon size ball from the dough and roll it in a small puri.
1. Put 1 tablespoon matar and gobi stuffing in between and cover it from all the sides.
1. Pat it and again roll it to make a paratha.
1. Heat a skillet and put the paratha on it.
1. Drizzle some oil on all the sides and cook the paratha till it is cooked properly from both the sides.
1. Serve Matar Gobi Paratha along with Green Chilli Pickle and Tadka Raita for a weekday breakfast.
