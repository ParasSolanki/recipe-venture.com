### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoon Caster Sugar.
- 1 teaspoon Corn flour.
- 85 grams Butter (unsalted) - cold and cubed.
- Salt - a pinch.
- 1 Whole Egg.
- 6-8 Strawberries - large.
- 1 teaspoon Caster Sugar.
- 1/4 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- 125 grams All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 2-3 tablespoon Water - Chilled.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Strawberry Compote Galette, we will first have to get the pie dough ready and refrigerate it for a couple of hours.
1. In a large mixing bowl, sieve out the flour, salt and sugar.
1. Add the cold and cubed unsalted butter into the floor.
1. You can make this dough in the food processor as well.
1. Work the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
1. When you hold the flour together, it should hold tight and when you let it loose, it will fall apart.
1. With a knife, pastry cutter or your hands, cut the butter into the flour.
1. The texture should be as that of coarse breadcrumbs.
1. Don't worry if there are chunks of butter, it ll just make the pastry flakier when it bakes.
1. Sprinkle ice water onto the flour and butter mixture.
1. Using your hands push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together.
1. Do not knead the dough.
1. Make sure to add little water at a time, as the heat from your hands will melt the butter and help form the dough as well.
1. You can transfer the pie dough on to a work surface and knead the dough until all the flour has come together to form a smooth dough.
1. Once done, wrap the dough in a cling film or a plastic wrap and refrigerate it for a couple of hours.
1. This refrigeration process helps to give the pie crust a flaky texture.
1. As the dough rests, preheat oven to 200C.
1. To make the filling:Slice the strawberries into 1/4 cm thick slices.
1. Add the caster sugar, cornflour ,and vanilla essence into the strawberry and mix well.
1. On a piece of parchment paper, sprinkle some flour, roll out the dough to a circle around 9 to10 inches in size and 1/4 inch thick.
1. Add the strawberry filling in the centre, spread the filling at least 2 inches away from the edge of the dough.
1. Fold the edges over, or you can also pleat the edges of the dough to make it decorative .
1. Make sure fruit in the centre is still exposed.
1. Transfer the parchment to your baking tray.
1. Brush the beaten egg or milk over the dough.
1. Sieve some caster sugar over the dough and fruit.
1. Bake for 35 -45 mins at 200 C / 400 F until pastry is golden brown.
1. Serve Strawberry Compote Galette along with Chicken Crepe Lasagne Recipe and Roasted Tomato And Pumpkin Soup Recipe to make it a beautiful Sunday lunch.
