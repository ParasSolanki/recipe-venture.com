### Ingredients

- 3/4 cup Roasted Gram Dal (Pottukadalai).
- 1 cup Roasted Peanuts (Moongphali) - halved.
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.
- 2 cups Jaggery - grated.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Roasted Peanut & Fried Gram Chikki Recipe, first grease a rectangular tray with ghee and set aside.
1. Place a heavy bottomed pan over medium heat, add the roasted peanuts and the roasted gram dal and stir for a couple of minutes until you get a roasted aroma.
1. Since these are already pre-roasted, you just need to warm them to get the flavors out.
1. Place it on the kitchen paper towel.
1. In the same heavy bottomed pan, add the grated jaggery.
1. With heat on low allow the jaggery to melt.
1. Stir in between and remove the scum if any.
1. When the jaggery tends to thicken and turn dark colour, add the ghee.
1. Give the mixture a gentle stir.
1. At this stage, add the roasted peanuts and the roasted fried gram.
1. Stir well into the jaggery and ghee mixture for another couple of minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Spread evenly onto a greased plate and flatten the Roasted Peanut & Fried Gram Chikki with back side of a big spoon or wooden spatula or rolling pin.
1. Leave the mixture to cool for 1-2 minutes and the chikki will begin to set itself into shape and become brittle.
1. If you want square pieces, take a sharp knife and run through the surface on the evenly spread mixture.
1. If you wish to make balls of the chikki, then grease your palm and fingers and take portions of the chikki while it is still warm and roll them into balls.
1. Once shaped and cut, the Roasted Peanut & Fried Gram Chikki is ready to be served with your evening Masala Chai.
1. Store in an airtight container for more than a couple of week and enjoy the healthy snack.
1. Serve the Roasted Peanut & Fried Gram Chikki along with your evening Masala Chai.
