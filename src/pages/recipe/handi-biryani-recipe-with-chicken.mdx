### Instructions

1. To begin making Handi Biryani Recipe With Chicken, first marinate the chopped chicken pieces in a large bowl with curd, salt, half of the pepper powder, half of ginger-garlic paste and red chilli powder for 30 minutes.
1. Also soak rice for 20 minutes and drain all the water once done with soaking them, and keep aside.
1. Meanwhile, you can cook the eggs till hardboiled.
1. Once the egg is boiled, peel the shell.
1. Heat a shallow frying pan with a little oil or ghee.
1. Once hot, slice each egg to four pieces, and fry them on all sides till browned.
1. Reserve these boiled and fried eggs for serving the handi biryani.
1. Once the eggs are prepared, the rice is soaked, and the chicken is marinated, proceed with making the biryani.
1. In a handi, heat a tablespoon of ghee and on a medium heat, add the marinated chicken pieces along with the leftover marinade.
1. Cook for 5-7 minutes or till the chicken is softer and at least half-cooked.
1. Once done, take them out and keep them aside.
1. Add some more ghee into the handi and add ginger juice, cover the handi for a minute to temper the ghee.
1. Add bay leaves, and rest of the whole masalas like clove, cardamom, cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, black pepper, and bay leaves and cook for a minute or till amazingly fragrant.
1. Now add the chopped onions and cook until it is golden brown.

1. Now add the half done chicken pieces and cook for a few more minutes.
1. Be prepared with the hot water to add to the recipe by this time as well.
1. Amount of hot water also depends on the rice that you are using.
1. We want this to be on the fluffier side and hence, adjust the water accordingly.
1. Check the salt and adjust if required.
1. Bring the biryani to a boil and close the lid, stirring occasionally.
1. Once the mixture has come to a rolling boil, add the drained rice and cook for 15-20 minutes or till the rice is cooked well.
