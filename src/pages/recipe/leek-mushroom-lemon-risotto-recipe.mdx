### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese - aged.
- Lemon juice - from one lemon.
- 2 Leek - thinly sliced (only white part).
- 1/2 cup Risotto Rice.
- 1/4 cup White Wine.
- 1 tablespoon Butter.
- Lemon zest - from one lemon.
- Salt and Pepper - to taste.
- 3 cloves Garlic - finely chopped.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Leek Mushroom & Lemon Risotto, heat the butter and olive oil in a heavy bottom pan over a medium heat.
1. Add the garlic, leek and mushroom and saute for 2-3 minutes until leeks and the mushrooms get lightly soft.
1. Add the rice and wine and bring to the the risotto to a brisk boil.
1. Reduce the heat and simmer till wine is completely absorbed.
1. Once the wine is completely evaporated, add the vegetable stock and simmer until the rice is completely cooked and all the stock is absorbed.
1. If the stock dries up before the rice is cooked add a little more warm water or stock and keep stirring intermittently so the rice does not get burn from the bottom and gets cooked evenly.
1. Once the rice is cooked, stir in the cheese, salt, lemon zest, lemon juice and stir until the cheese melts into the risotto.
1. Finally sprinkle crushed black pepper.
1. Serve the Leek Mushroom & Lemon Risotto warm along with a side of Rustic Rosemary Garlic Zucchini Bread and a glass of wine for a weekend dinner.
