### Ingredients

- 1 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- Badam (Almond) - few.
- 1/4 cup Almond Meal (Badam Powder).
- Saffron strands - few.
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 1/2 cup Butter (unsalted) - softened.
- 1/4 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1/2 cup Caster Sugar - powdered.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Eggless Saffron Laced Almond Cookies recipe, soak the saffron in warm milk and keep aside for about 30 minutes.
1. In a mixing bowl, using a whisk or spoon, mix the maida, salt and badam powder.
1. In another bowl, beat the softened butter with a beater or by hand till softened.
1. Add the sugar to the softened butter and beat well to a light and fluffy mixture.
1. Add half of the flour mixture and mix gently.
1. Pour in the rest of the flour and saffron in milk and mix gently to a soft dough.
1. If the dough is sticky, add a tablespoon or more of flour and if it is dry, add a few teaspoons of milk to make a soft dough that does not stick to your hands.
1. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 15 minutes (optional, but helps in preventing the cookie from spreading too much).
1. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Centigrade.
1. Grease a large baking pan with butter or oil or line with parchment paper.
1. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and make small 1-inch balls and place them fairly apart on the baking sheet.
1. Press half of a badam or almond on top of some and chopped badam in the rest.
1. (While baking one batch of cookies, place the rest of the dough, covered in the refrigerator).
1. Repeat with the rest of the dough.
1. Bake in preheated oven for about 20 to 22 minutes till edges are slightly brown.
1. Remove from oven and leave on baking pan to cool slightly.
1. At this stage, the cookies will be soft.
1. After about a minute or two, gently remove the cookies from the pan and place on wire rack to cool completely.
1. Once cool, store in airtight box and enjoy these crispy and saffron laced almond butter cookies.
1. Eggless Saffron Laced Almond Cookies goes great with coffee or masala tea and perfect to share with family and friends at a tea party with Grilled Rajma Masala Sandwich and Coconut & Ricotta Dip with Banana Chips.
