### Instructions

1. To begin making the Spicy Coconut Peanut Stuffed Baby Brinjal recipe, make 2 way slit in the eggplants (2 vertical slit perpendicular to each other.
1. Do not make the slit through till the end) and keep aside.
1. Let us prepare the stuffing for the eggplants now.
1. For this, dry roast peanuts and dried coconut to a light golden brown.
1. Let it cool down.
1. Now, using a food processor/chopper, grind these along with cumin seeds, coriander powder, garam masala, salt and red chili powder into a homogeneous mix.
1. Add in the tomato paste and chopped coriander.
1. Combine.
1. Stuff the eggplants with the stuffing well and keep them in the fridge for 10 minutes so that the stuffing gets a little solid and does not ooze out when stir fried.
1. Now, take a non stick pan and in it add in the mustard/vegetable oil.
1. Heat it up and add in the mustard seeds.
1. Let the seeds splutter.
1. Now add in the sliced garlic and roast till lightly golden.
1. Now, add in the stuffed eggplants and toss around the tempering.
1. Add in the required amount of salt.
1. Let it cook on medium high for the next 15 to 20 minutes till the eggplants start to cook and get tender.
1. Now, place a lid on the pan and cook on simmer for another 5 to 7 minutes.
1. After 5 to 7 minutes, they are done and ready to serve.
1. Spicy Coconut Peanut Stuffed Baby Brinjal tastes best when served along with flatbreads likeWhole Wheat Palak Naan Recipe, rotis, parathas or steamed rice.
