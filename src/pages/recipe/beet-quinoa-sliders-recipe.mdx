### Instructions

1. To begin making the Beet Quinoa Sliders recipe, we will first cook the quinoa in a pressure cooker.
1. First rinse the quinoa well under running water.
1. Place quinoa along with 1 cup of water in the pan of the pressure cooker.
1. Keep the weight on, cover the pressure cooker.
1. Cook on medium high heat and after the first whistle turn the heat to low.
1. Once you turn the heat to low, simmer for 3 minutes.
1. After 3 minutes, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally and then open the pressure.
1. Fluff up the quinoa and keep it aside.
1. Next we will pressure cook the sweet potatoes.
1. Wash and peel the sweet potato.
1. Chop into chunks and add it into a pressure cooker.
1. Add 1/2 cup of water.
1. Place the lid on the pressure cooker pan with its weight placed on it and allow it to cook until you hear 4 whistles.
1. After 4 whistles, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. After the pressure has released remove the potatoes from the pressure cooker.
1. Let them cool and mash and keep aside.
1. In a pan add some oil, the onions and garlic and saute until the onions caramelised.
1. After the onions have caramelized add the grated beetroot and saute till the moisture evaporates.
1. Turn off the heat and allow to cool.
1. To make the Beet Quinoa Burger PattyTransfer the cooled onions and beetroot into a large mixing bowl along with the mashed sweet potato and cooked quinoa.
1. Add all the other ingredients as well like the cumin powder, tofu, walnuts, bread crumbs, coriander leaves, red chilli powder, black pepper powder, dry parsley leaves, dried oregano, dried basil leaves, lemon juice, red chilli sauce and salt to taste.
1. Mix well to combine.
1. Divide the mixture into 8 portions and shape them like a burger and lay them on a lined tray and rest it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour so the flavours are absorbed into the patties.
1. After one hour into a preheated pan add some oil.
1. Once the oil is hot place the burger patties on the pan and pan fry them till golden brown on both sides.
1. Remove when done and let it cool.
1. To assemble the Beet quinoa slidersSlice the buns into half.
1. Take one half of the bun and spread mayonnaise, mustard.
1. Layer with.
1. lettuce, pickled jalapenos and avocados.
1. Place a beet quinoa patty on top and close with the other slice of bun and serve.
1. If avocados are not available you can add sliced onions and tomatoes as well.
1. Serve Beet Quinoa Sliders with a glass of chilled Pomegranate Mint Cocktail Recipe for a house party or weekend dinner.
