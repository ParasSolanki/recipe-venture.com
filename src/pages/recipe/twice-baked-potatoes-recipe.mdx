### Instructions

1. To begin making the Twice Baked Potatoes first preheat the oven to 180 degrees C.
1. Rub the cleaned potatoes with some oil and salt.
1. Take a square of aluminium foil and wrap each potato tightly inside it.
1. When the oven is hot enough, place the covered potatoes on a baking sheet and bake them for 30 minutes until tender.
1. When done, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool slightly.
1. Open the potatoes up and halve them.
1. Scoop the flesh out leaving just enough inside so the potato forms a firm shell outside.
1. Collect the baked potato in a bowl and set aside till later use.
1. Meanwhile, in a skillet heat 1/2 tablespoon butter over medium heat.
1. Add the onions, green chilli, salt and pepper and cook down till the onions are nicely browned.
1. This might take 7-8 minutes.
1. Next, add the garlic, ginger and cook until fragrant.
1. Stir in the peas and toss to coat well.
1. Transfer the mixture into a medium bowl.
1. In the same skillet melt remaining butter, add cumin powder, turmeric powder, kashmiri chilli powder, flour, asafetida and stir for few seconds.
1. Slowly add the broth and simmer until the sauce thickens.
1. Add the prepared onion, green peas mixture which you had set aside.
1. Add the scooped baked potato to this too along with sour cream, dry mango powder, chopped coriander leaves stir to combine.
1. Check for salt and pepper or season if needed.
1. Divide the mixture equally to the halved potato shells.
1. Top them with grated cheese and bake for about 12 to 15 minutes or until the top of the cheese is golden brown.
1. Serve the Twice Baked Potatoes as a warm appetiser along with Roasted Vegetable Lasagna With Ricotta for a weeknight dinner.
