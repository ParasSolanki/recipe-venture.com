### Instructions

1. To begin making the Paal Kozhukattai Recipe With Bananas, let us start with preparing the rice dumplings.
1. In a small pot, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to boil.
1. Once the water starts boiling, add sesame oil and turn off the heat.
1. In a bowl, add rice flour and salt.
1. Combine them together.
1. Add water slowly little by little and mix continuously to prepare the dough.
1. Knead the dough together to prepare a soft dough.
1. Once the dough comes together, grease your palm with oil and roll small balls of dough .
1. I rolled the dough into small coin shaped ones as I preferred a different shape than the usual round ones.
1. Ensure the dough is covered with damp cloth all the time to prevent it from losing its moisture.
1. This also prevents the dough from cracking while cooking.
1. Repeat the same with the entire dough and prepare small coins out of the dough.
1. Keep the rolled balls covered with damp cloth at all times.
1. In a nonstick pan, add milk and bring it to boil.
1. Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat and add shaped rice balls into the milk.
1. Cook the rice balls for about 5 minutes without stirring.
1. Ensure that you don’t stir the rice balls until they are cooked to avoid breaking the rice balls.
1. The balls will float on the top once it has been cooked.
1. Now, add thin coconut milk and cardamom powder to the pot and bring it to boil.
1. Add sugar and give a stir.
1. Cook for few minutes until the sugar dissolves completely in the milk.
1. Now, add thick coconut milk and turn off the heat.
1. Remove the Paal Kozhukattai  from the heat.
1. Ensure you don’t cook the Paal Kozhukattai after the addition of thick coconut milk.
1. Serve warm or refrigerate for an hour before serving.
1. Paal Kozhukattai tastes delicious either warm or cold.
1. Serve Paal Kozhukattai Recipe With Bananas as a dessert after a festive meal of Steamed Rice, Mixed Vegetable Sambar, Carrot Beans Thoran and Elai Vadam.
