### Ingredients

- 300 grams Hung Curd (Greek Yogurt).
- 120 grams Caster Sugar.
- 150 ml Fresh cream.
- 3 teaspoon Gulkand.
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- 1-1/2 tablespoons Agar agar - or gelatin.
- 1/4 cup Water.
- 12 Betel leaves (paan).
- 200 grams Paneer (Homemade Cottage Cheese).

### Instructions

1. To begin making Eggless Paan Cheesecake Recipe, dissolve the gelatin or agar agar in a bowl of water and keep aside.
1. In a blender, blend the paneer and hung curd together to obtain a smooth mixture.
1. In a large bowl, mix together the paneer and curd mixture along with the fresh cream, add sugar and vanilla extract and mix well.
1. Add the meetha paan mix and stir well, then pour in the gelatin with the water (the gelatin will have bloomed by now, about 10-15 minutes).
1. Place this mixture in the refrigerator for about 20-25 minutes, till it semi-sets.
1. It should be soft and pipe able, but not runny.
1. While it sets, prepare each betel leaf by rolling it into a tight cone and holding the cone in place using a toothpick, or within the moulds of a kulfi set.
1. Stir the mixture around to ensure an even consistency and then pour it into a piping bag or a ziplock bag with the end cut off, so that it is easier to fill into the paan leaf cones.
1. You can also just use a spoon to fill the cones.
1. Hold the cones upright by placing in glasses/conical moulds and pipe in the cheesecake mixture.
1. Once all the leaves are filled, refrigerate again till fully set and firm, around 20 more minutes.
1. Your Eggless Paan Cheesecake Recipe is ready.
1. You can garnish it with shaved coconut or a cherry.
1. Enjoy!Serve Eggless Paan Cheesecake as a dessert or to satiate evening sweet cravings after a meal of Barnyard Millet Mushroom Biryani and Mirchi Ka Salan.
