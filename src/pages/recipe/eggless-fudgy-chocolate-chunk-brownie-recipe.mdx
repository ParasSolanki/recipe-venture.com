1. Gradually beat in the vanilla extract, the flour mixture and beat until all the ingredients have come together.
1. Don't over beat at this stage.
1. Once done, fold in the chocolate chunks and pour the Fudgy Chocolate Chunk Brownie Batter into the prepared cake pan.
1. Bake the chocolate chunk brownie for 25 mins or until a tester inserted inside comes out clean with cooked crumbs sticking to it.
1. The cake should not be raw and its ok to have crumbs sticking to the tester.
1. Once done, remove the Fudgy Chocolate Chunk Brownie from the oven and allow it to cool a bit.
1. Cut the Fudgy Chocolate Chunk Brownie into squares and serve warm along with vanilla ice cream or as it is.
1. Serve the Fudgy Brownie Recipe with Chocolate Chunks along with a glass of Oreo Milkshake Recipe or just serve it plain with a scoop of Icecream to make a nice comforting dessert.
