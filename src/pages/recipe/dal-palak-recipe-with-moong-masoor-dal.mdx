### Instructions

1. To begin making the Dal Palak recipe we will first cook the lentils (dal) using a pressure cooker using 3 cups of water.
1. See video recipe of how to cook lentils using pressure cooker.
1. Next we will cook the spinach with the spices.
1. There are two ways you can do it - in a sauce pan by sauteeing it or in a pressure cooker.
1. Below you will find the recipe of how you cook the spinach in a pressure cooker, as the method is really fast.
1. If you are using a saucepan method, then follow the same procedure, but just cover the pan and cook until the spinach is soft.
1. Into a pressure cooker, add a teaspoon of oil; add the ginger, green chillies, tomatoes, turmeric powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, salt and spinach.
1. Stir all the ingredients together just to combine them.
1. Once combined, cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on.
1. Pressure cook until you hear one whistle.
1. After the first whistle, turn off the heat.
1. We will now place the pressure cooker under cold running water to release the pressure immediately.
1. This way, we will release the pressure quickly and the spinach does not get over-cooked and remain fresh and green.
1. Now that you have the spinach and lentils ready, if your cooker is large enough, add the cooked dal into the spinach and give it a stir.
1. Bring the Dal Palak to a quick boil.
1. Our next step is to proceed to make the seasoning.
1. Into a small saucepan, heat a tablespoon of ghee.
1. Add in the cumin seeds and dry red chillies.
1. Roast them until they crackle and sizzle.
1. Add this seasoning to the Dal Palak and give it a stir.
1. Serve the Dal Palak for a simple and healthy weeknight dinner along with steamed rice or Paneer Pulav or traditional Tawa Parathas.
1. Also, do make sure to slice up some onions, squeeze in some lemon and toss it along with salt and serve it with the Dal Palak.
1. The combination is delicious.
