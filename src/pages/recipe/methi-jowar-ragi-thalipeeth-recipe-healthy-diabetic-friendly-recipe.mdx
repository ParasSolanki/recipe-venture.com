1. Pour a teaspoon of oil around and let the Methi Jowar Ragi Thalipeeth cook on the base for about 4 minutes.
1. Flip over the thalipeeth and cook on the other side.
1. Likewise, prepare the rest of the Methi Jowar Ragi Thalipeeth .
1. Serve the nutritious Methi Ragi Jowar Thalipeeth Recipe along with chilled Yogurt , Red Chilli Thecha and Ginger Cardamom Chai Recipe for healthy indian breakfast or a healthy diabetic breakfast, lunch or dinner.
