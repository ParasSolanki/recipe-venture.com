- 1/2 cup Provolone Cheese -  grated.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kale And Leeks Frittata, in a medium bowl add eggs, parmesan cheese, provolone cheese, thyme, oregano, salt, pepper whisk well until fluffy and keep aside.
1. In a cast iron skillet heat oil, add garlic and onions and saute them until golden brown and the onions will have a slightly caramelised flavor and smell.
1. Once done, add chopped leeks (white part) and cook until soft and tender.
1. This will take about 5 minutes.
1. Once the stems have softened, add leeks greens and kale or spinach.
1. Sprinkle some salt and allow the leaves to cook through until all most of the moisture released while cooking is evaporated.
1. Pour in the egg and cheese mixture to this.
1. Swirl to spread the egg into the kale and leek mixture, so it spreads to the entire base of the pan.
1. Cook the frittata for 7 minutes or until the edge is just set.
1. Add the ricotta cheese on the top and cover with a lid and cook until eggs are puffed up.
1. Once cooked through from the top and the frittata is puffed up, turn off the heat and serve.
1. Serve the Kale And Leeks Frittata along with buttered toast, Mulled Apple Juice and fruits to make a wholesome breakfast.
