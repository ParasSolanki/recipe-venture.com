1. To begin making Puffed Rice Upma Recipe (Murmura Upma), place the puffed rice in a strainer and wash it under running water for 30 seconds and set aside on a bowl for all the excess water to drain out.
1. Alternatively, if you like the upma crunchy you can directly add the puffed rice without washing it.
1. Heat a heavy bottomed pan or kadai with a tablespoon of oil on medium flame.
1. Once the oil heats up, add mustard seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Add cumin seeds and peanuts and roast on medium heat until the raw peanuts get a roasted aroma and are crisp.
1. Once the peanuts are roasted, add the ginger, onions, green chillies and curry leaves with a little salt and saut√© until transparent.
1. Add peas, turmeric powder, tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until the tomatoes are tender and soft.
1. Stir in the Murmura (Puffed Rice), coriander leaves, lemon juice and stir everything together.
1. Check the salt and spice, adjust to suit your taste and serve.
1. Serve the Puffed Rice Upma for a quick and easy weekday breakfast or even as a tea time snack when you have some guests over along with some Kesar Chai Recipe - A Delicious Saffron Flavored Indian Tea.
