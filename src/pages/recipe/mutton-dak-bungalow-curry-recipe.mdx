### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mutton Dak Bungalow Curry recipe, we will first marinate the mutton.
1. Take the goat meat under the water at room temperature, and clean very well.
1. Now put the meat in a large pasta strainer for 30 minutes to drain all the excess water.
1. Now put the clean meat in a large bowl, add sour curd, ginger garlic paste, red chili powder, kashmiri red chili powder, turmeric powder & mustard oil and marinate all together very well.
1. Rub the pieces of meat with the marination.
1. Cover the pan and leave the marinated meat for overnight or 6-8 hours.
1. Remove the marinated meat 2 hours before cooking.
1. In the meantime make the "special spice powder" by dry grinding all the ingredients under the heading of "Special Spice Powder", in a spice grinder.
1. Pour the "Special Spice Powder" in an airtight container and keep aside.
1. The next step is to prepare the gravy.
1. Take the boiled egg and prick the skin of the egg to prevent from bursting while frying.
1. Now marinate the boiled eggs and potatoes with some salt and turmeric powder and keep aside for 10 minutes.
1. Heat oil and ghee in a large non-stick pan, fry the marinated eggs and potatoes till they are golden brown, take them out of the pan and keep aside.
1. Now in the same pan add Bay leaf, Radhuni & Methi and fry for a few seconds, but be careful, do not let the Methi burn.
1. Add sliced onion and some salt and cover the pan for 2 minutes.
1. Open the lid after 2 minutes and fry the onion till golden brown.
1. Add ginger garlic paste to the pan and fry again for 1 minutes.
1. Add sliced tomatoes and fry till the tomatoes are pulpy.
1. Now add the marinated meat and the "special spice powder" to the pan and cover it for 5 minutes.
1. After 5 minutes open the lid, and start frying on medium heat for 30 minutes.
1. If the masala starts burning at the bottom, sprinkle some water and again fry.
1. Add the fried potatoes to the pan and 2 cups of water.
1. Here you can cook the meat in Pressure Cooker or in the same pan.
1. If you are using a pressure cooker, then add all the meat along with the spices into the cooker, close the lid and cook for 10 minutes or upto 4 whistles.
1. Let release all the pressures of the cooker by itself, and open the cooker and add the fried eggs now.
1. Boil the curry for 5 minutes and turn off the heat and serve with plain rice and cucumber salad.
1. ORIf you are cooking the meat in the pan, then cover the pan, lower the heat and let the gravy boil for 20-30 minutes or till the meat is soft and tender.
1. When the meat is well cooked, open the lid and serve hot.
1. Serve Mutton Dak Bungalow along with Phulka and Jeera Rice for a weekday meal.
