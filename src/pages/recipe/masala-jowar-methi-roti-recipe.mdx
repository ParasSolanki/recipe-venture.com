### Instructions

1. To begin making Jowar Methi roti, heat water in a pan and add salt and oil.
1. Mix it well.
1. The water has to be luke warm to knead the flour.
1. In a mixing bowl, add the jowar flour, wheat flour, methi leaves, red chilli powder, turmeric powder and salt and knead well.
1. Keep adding little luke warm water at a time until the dough becomes soft and non-sticky.
1. It should be kneaded properly, as we will make the rotiâ€™s immediately without giving any resting time to the dough.
1. Keep the dough covered with clean damp cloth so that it does not dry.
1. The next step is to cook the rotis.
1. Keep a iron tawa/griddle on medium flame.
1. Dust your rolling surface with little whole wheat flour.
1. Now we will start making the rotis using our hands.
1. Divide the dough into 6 - 8 equal portions and roll out a portion of the dough into a round and thick roti using your hands.
1. You can shape the roti by pressing out a circle with your fingers as well.
1. Place the roti over the pre-heated skillet and cook it for a few seconds on one side or till a few bubbles appear on top.
1. Turn over the roti and cook the other side for a few more seconds.
1. Lift the roti with tongs and roast over the direct flame till brown spots appear on both the sides.
1. Similarly, prepare the remaining Rotis.
1. Serve the Masala Jowar Methi Roti Recipe along with Smoked Dal Makhani Dhaba Style, Jain Style Whole Green Moong Dal Subzi and raita by the side to enjoy your lunch.
