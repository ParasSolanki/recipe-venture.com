### Instructions

1. To begin making the Lahsuni Palak Dal Recipe, we will first cook the dal until soft.
1. Rinse the place the Moong Dal in the pressure cooker.
1. Add salt and 3 cups of water, cover the pan, place the weight on and pressure cook until you hear one whistle.
1. After the first whistle, turn the heat to low and simmer the dal for 3 to 4 minutes.
1. After about 3 to 4 minutes, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. The dal continues to cook under the pressure even when the heat is turned off.
1. Once the dal is cooked, whisk it until smooth and keep aside.
1. Our next step is to cook the spinach.
1. Heat the ghee in a heavy bottomed saucepan on medium heat; add the chopped spinach, the turmeric powder, red chilli powder, cumin powder and salt.
1. Saute the spinach on low to medium heat, until it is completely cooked through.
1. Once the spinach is cooked, stir in the cooked dal and give the Lahsuni Palak Dal a quick boil.
1. Turn off the heat and transfer the Dal Palak to a serving bowl.
1. Heat ghee in a small pan; add the cumin seeds and the garlic.
1. Saute until the garlic turns lightly brown and the aromas are coming through.
1. Pour the Garlic (Lahsun) Tadka over the Dal Palak and serve.
1. Serve the Lahsuni Palak Dal along with phulka or steamed rice.
