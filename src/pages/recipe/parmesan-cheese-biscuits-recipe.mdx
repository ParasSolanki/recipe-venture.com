1. To begin making the Parmesan Cheese Biscuits recipe, in a bowl add the flour and butter (you can do this step using a food processor or by hand like I did).

1. Add cheese and chilli flakes to the flour and butter and mix till it comes together into a ball.
1. Roll the dough into a log shape (make two logs so it’s easier to roll), wrap in cling film and chill in the refrigerator for an hour or until firm.
1. Preheat oven to 180C.
1. Cut the dough log in to rounds of 1/3rd inch thickness and place on a baking sheet leaving an inch between each biscuit.
1. Put the baking tray in the freezer for 10 minutes.
1. Place in the oven straight from the freezer and bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden.
1. Serve Parmesan Cheese Biscuits along with Hot Masala Tea as your tea time snack.
