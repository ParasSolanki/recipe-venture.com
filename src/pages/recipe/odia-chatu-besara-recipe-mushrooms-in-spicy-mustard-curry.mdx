### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - as required.
- Salt - to taste.
- 5 teaspoons Coriander (Dhania) Seeds.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 400 grams Button mushrooms.
- 1-1/2 tablespoons Mustard seeds.
- 1 Potato (Aloo).
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 2 Tomatoes.
- 5 Dry Red Chillies.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chatu Besara Recipe first clean the mushrooms thoroughly under running water.
1. Cut them into halves and keep aside.
1. Peel the potato and chop it into small pieces and keep it in a bowl of water until it is needed.
1. Setting chopped potatoes aside in water helps retain their colour.
1. Next, prepare the mustard paste.
1. Place all the ingredients listed under “for mustard paste” into a blender and grind to a fine but thick paste.
1. Add as little water as possible in order to ensure that the paste is thick and not runny.
1. Now, to begin making the curry, add about 2 tablespoons of oil into a kadai or a heavy bottomed pan on a medium heat.
1. First add the potatoes, sprinkle some salt and saute until they are almost cooked and get a light brown colour.
1. Once the potatoes are cooked, transfer them to a paper towel to drain the excess oil and keep aside.
1. In the same kadai, add the chopped tomatoes and toss them for a minute.
1. Next, add the chopped mushrooms.
1. Saute these on high heat for 6-8 minutes, until the mushrooms are half cooked.
1. Add the roasted potatoes and turmeric powder and toss together for another couple of minutes.
1. To this, add the prepared mustard paste, mix well and saute for 2 more minutes.
1. Add salt and required amount of water of the gravy, as per the consistency you desire.
1. Allow the curry to come to a boil so the masalas get cooked thoroughly.
1. Simmer the Odia Chatu Besara on low to medium heat for about 5 minutes, until all the masalas get well absorbed by the vegetables.
1. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve the Odia Chatu Besara along with dinner.
