### Instructions

1. To begin making the Malvani Chana Masala Recipe, we will first keep the ingredients ready for the malvani masala.
1. Preheat a pan over medium heat; add the spices for the malvani masala into the pan and roast for about a minute until you can smell the aromas coming through.
1. You will also notice the spices change color, as they are getting roasted.
1. Once roasted, allow the spices to cool.
1. Once cooled, blend them into a smooth powder and keep aside.
1. In the meantime pressure cook the soaked chana for at least 6 to 10 whistle or for 25 minutes in a pressure cooker along with 3 cups of water and salt to taste.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the kala chana is cooked, take out about 1/4 cup of cooked chana and blend it in a mixer to a coarse paste.
1. This is done to give a thick texture to the Malvani kala chana gravy.
1. Once the chana is blended, keep it aside.
1. Heat oil in a kadai over medium heat; add mustard seeds and cumin seeds and allow it to crackle for few seconds.
1. Add chopped garlic and saut√© till they soften.
1. Add in the powdered Malvani masala onto the kadai and stir fry for a few seconds.
1.  Stir in the ground kala chana masala paste, the cooked chana masala, tamarind water, jaggery and cream and give it a stir.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to taste accordingly.
1. Add water if required to give the Malvani Kala Chana Masala a curry like consistency.
1. Bring the Malvani Kala Chana Masala to a brisk boil.
1. Turn the heat to low and simmer the masala for about 5 minutes so the masalas get well incorporated into the Kala Chana.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and transfer the Malvani Kala Chana Masala to a serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve the Malvani Chana Masala Recipe along with Malabar Parotta, Steamed Rice, Beetroot, Carrot & Cucumber Salad with Peanuts for lunch or dinner.
