1. Add vegetable stock into the wok and bring it to a boil.
1. Add the mashed dal, tamarind extract and salt to taste.
1. Be careful with the salt since vegetable stock will have some salt in it.
1. Cook this for 7-8 minutes or until you smell a flavourful broth, now add the coconut milk and cook for 2-3 minutes.
1. To this, add the finely chopped veggies including onions, cabbage, sprouts and cook until the veggies and sprouts are soft but not mushy.
