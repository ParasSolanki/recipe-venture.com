### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Chikki (peanut brittle) - optional.
- 65 grams Butter (unsalted).
- 65 grams Caster Sugar.
- 115 grams Dark chocolate.
- 50 grams Almond Meal (Badam Powder).
- 1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- 3 Whole Eggs - (or Flax meal Egg Replacer).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Flourless Chocolate Mud Pie Recipe, we will first melt the chocolate using the double boiler method.
1. First, place a saucepan on medium heat with 250 ml of water and bring it to a gentle simmer.
1. Place a heat proof bowl over the saucepan such that the water is not in direct contact with the heatproof bowl.
1. We will henceforth refer to this arrangement as bain-marie.
1. In the bain-marie, melt bite size pieces of chocolate and butter until a smooth mixture is formed.
1. We will now take the bowl off heat and set it aside until partially cooled.
1. Meanwhile, let's separate the egg whites and the yolks.
1. Beat the egg whites with an electric beater or wire whisk until stiff peaks are formed.
1. Note: If you plan to make this recipe eggless (egg free) then prepare the Flax meal Egg Replacer and keep it aside.
1. When the chocolate mixture cools, fold in the sugar, ground almonds, vanilla essence and egg yolks with a rubber spatula.
1. Note: Add the Flax meal Egg Replacer at the above stage.
1. Further, fold the beaten egg whites gently into the chocolate mixture by taking care, not to deflate the egg-chocolate mixture.
1. This step is crucial to help maintain the consistency of the mud pie.
1.  (Skip this step for egg free cake)Now, we shall pour the chocolate mixture into a lined and greased spring foam tin and bake in a preheated 180C oven for 30 to 35 minutes until just set.
1. You will notice when a tester like a pick or a knife inserted into the center comes almost clean, but not completely.
1. The mud pies most often will have a few cake crumbs that get stuck to the center, but it's not raw.
1. Once the mud pie is baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool.
1. Take care to unmould the cake only when completely cooled.
1. An optional step would be to whip up a simple chocolate ganache and slather it all over the mud pie.
1. I also topped it with store bought peanut brittle to give it a little crunch.
1. Butterscotch will work wonders too.
