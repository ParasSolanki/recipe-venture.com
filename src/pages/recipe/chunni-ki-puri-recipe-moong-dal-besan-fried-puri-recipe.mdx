### Ingredients

- Sunflower Oil - for deep frying.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/2 cup Gram flour (besan).
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 1/4 cup Yellow Moong Dal (Split) - washed.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chunni ki Puri / Dal & Besan Puri Recipe, wash and soak the moong dal for 20 minutes.
1. In a pressure cooker, add the dal along with 1/2 cup of water and pressure cook for 2 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure has released, mash dal with a whisk or churner, and allow it to cool.
1. There will be very little water remaining which you can use to make the poori dough.
1. In a large mixing bowl, add whole wheat flour, besan, salt, hing and the mashed dal.
1. Add a little water if required and knead into a firm dough.
1. Add a teaspoon of oil on the top and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.
1. Cover with a muslin cloth and set aside.
1. In a heavy bottomed pan, add required amount of oil for frying the Dal & Besan Puri.
1. Divide the Dal & Besan Puri dough into equal portions, and dust the surface with whole wheat flour and flatten the dough balls with the rolling pin.
1. Roll them out into a 2-1/2 to 3 inch diameter circle.
1. Once the oil is heated, gently slice in the Dal & Besan Puri.
1. Using a slotted spoon, keep pouring oil over the puri and gently press the puri, so that the chunni ki puri puffs up.
1. At this point, turn the puri to the other side and fry till it turns golden brown.
1. Drain the Dal & Besan Puri on a kitchen towel to absorb the extra oil and serve hot.
1. Serve Chunni ki Puri/Dal & Besan Puri along with Jodhpuri Aloo Recipe or Rawal Pindi Style Chole Recipe and Boondi Raita for a weekday meal.
