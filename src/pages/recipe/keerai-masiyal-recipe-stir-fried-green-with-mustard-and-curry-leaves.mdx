1. If you use a pressure cooker, place the chopped keerai in the pressure cooker, sprinkle some salt, add a tablespoon of water and cover the cooker.
1. Place the weight on and pressure cooker for just one whistle.
1. As soon as you hear one whistle, turn off the heat and release the pressure immediately by placing the cooker under running cold water.
1. This will release the pressure immediately and stop the cooking process immediately.
1. Open the cooker and you will notice the keerai (greens) are lightly steamed and has a fresh green colour.
1. Our next step is to season the Keerai Masiyal to give it taste.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a wok or a kadai; add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves and allow it to crackle.
1. Stir in the asafoetida and finally the steamed keerai and stir fry it until the keerai gets well coated with the spices.
