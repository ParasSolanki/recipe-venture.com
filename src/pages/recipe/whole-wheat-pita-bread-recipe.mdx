### Ingredients

- 1-1/2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1-1/4 cups Lukewarm Water.
- 1-1/2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- 2 teaspoons Active dry yeast.
- 1-1/2 teaspoons Sugar.
- 1/2 teaspoons Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pita bread we will first have to get your ingredients ready especially the yeast.
1. If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.
1. If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky.
1. Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes.
1. Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.
1. Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.
1. After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled.
1. At this point punch the dough down and knead gently.
1. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball.
1. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.
1. While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C.
1. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them.
1. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread.
1. Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well.
1. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle.
1. Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick.
1. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.
1. Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven.
1. Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.
1. The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes.
1. If the pita bread does not rise in 5 minutes, then take them out.
1. The Pita Bread will still be cooked, but just wont have pockets and will still taste just as good.
1. You can serve Whole Wheat Pita Bread Recipe along with soups or make it into sandwiches like Egg Bhurji Stuffed Pita Pockets Recipe, Aloo Tikki Stuffed Pita Sandwich Recipe, Pita Sandwich With Cauliflower Falafel And Roasted Vegetables Recipe and more.
