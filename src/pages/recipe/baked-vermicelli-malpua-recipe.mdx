- Pistachios - a handful.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1/2 cup Milk.
- 1 pinch Baking soda.
- 1 teaspoon Fennel seeds (Saunf).

### Instructions

1. To begin making Baked Vermicelli Malpua Recipe, cook the vermicelli with required amount of water.
1. I used very fine roasted wheat vermicelli.
1. Drain the excess water and allow the vermicelli to cool down.
1. Meanwhile in a saucepan, make the sugar syrup by heating the sugar and water with 2 cardamom pods.
1. Boil it till it becomes slightly thick and sticky, I did not follow any string consistency here.
1. Take the vermicelli, lightly mash it with your hand, add cottage cheese mash well, milk powder, gulab jamun mix, fennel seeds, cardamom powder and baking soda.
1. Mix everything, add milk slowly and form a thick batter.
1. Let the batter stay in room temperature for an hour.
1. Grease a baking tray with oil and ghee, pour the batter with the help of a ladle, keeping space between each portion.
1. Bake in a preheated oven at 200 degrees C for 15 minutes.
1. I baked in a microwave convection oven .
1. You have to check with the time and temperature of your oven and keep a close eye on the baking malpua.
1. Once baked, dip each malpua in sugar syrup and take it out.
1. You can also drizzle the sugar syrup on the top if you prefer less sugar like me.
1. Garnish with some chopped pistachios and serve them warm.
