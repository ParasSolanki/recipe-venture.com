### Instructions

1. To begin making the Paniyaram Muttai Masala Recipe, we will firstly dry roast the whole spices for the Muttai Masala gravy in a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Heat a pan, add cumin seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, peppercorns, chana dal and dry red chilli.
1. Roast the spices until the spices get aromatic and the chana dal turns brown.
1. Turn off the heat and allow to cool.
1. Once the muttai masala spices have cooled, grind the roasted spices in a mixer into a smooth powder.
1. Next, we will make the tomato and onion gravy.
1. Place a heavy bottomed pan on medium heat and add one tablespoon of oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add in the chopped ginger, garlic and onions until the raw smell goes away and the onions are lightly browned.
1. Add in the chopped tomatoes and tamarind paste and saute until the tomatoes are soft and mushy.
1. Allow this mixture to cool down.
1. Add the tomato onion gravy along with the grated coconut and grind to a smooth paste with a little water.
1. Keep aside.
1. Place a heavy bottomed pan on medium heat and add a teaspoon of oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add mustard seeds and wait for it to crackle.
1. One the mustard seeds have crackled, add in the curry leaves and the tomato onion gravy.
1. Add a little water to get desired gravy consistency - about 1 cup of water would be good to start with.
1. Next add the ground and roasted muttai masala spice masala powder and give it all a good stir until the masalas are well combined.
1. The next step is to make the Muttai Paniyaram.
1. In a mixing bowl, break the eggs, add the chopped green chilies, salt, and chopped coriander and mix well.
1. Heat a paniyaram pan, add in a little oil into each cavity; once the pan is well heated, drop a tablespoon of the egg mixture into each cavity.
1. Cover the pan and allow it to cook.
1. After a couple minutes you could add a little more oil and then flip the eggs so it can get cooked from both sides.
1. Once this is done, add the muttai paniyaram to the masala gravy and let it cook for another minute.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Garnish the Paniyaram Muttai Masala Recipe with chopped coriander leaves and serve.
1. Serve the Paniyaram Muttai Masala Recipe with Malabari Parotta Without Egg Recipe (Kerala Parotta) or Jeera Rice (Pulao) Recipe (Cumin & Ghee Flavored Rice) and Burani Raita for a wholesome meal.
