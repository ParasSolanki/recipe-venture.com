### Ingredients

- 50 grams Gram flour (besan).

- 1 teaspoon Fennel seeds (Saunf).
- Sunflower Oil - as required.
- 1 teaspoon Chaat Masala Powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pan Fried Broccoli Pakora Recipe, combine all the ingredients together in a bowl including broccoli, onion, gram flour, fennel seeds, chaat masala powder and salt.
1. Add water little at a time, to make a thick pakora batter.
1. Check the salt, spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Preheat the Kuzhi Paniyaram Pan on medium heat; add a few drops of oil into each cavity.
1. Spoon the Broccoli Pakora batter into the cavity and pan-fry them until it is browned and crisp on both sides.
1. Each side will take about 3 to 4 minutes on low heat.
1. Once done transfer the Broccoli Pakoras onto a plate with an oil absorbent paper, so that it soaks up the excess oil from the Pakoras.
