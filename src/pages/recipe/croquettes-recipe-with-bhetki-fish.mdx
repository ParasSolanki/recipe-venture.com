1. Assembling and frying the Fish CroquettesSprinkle a little salt and black pepper to the mashed potatoes and mix well till combined.
1. Divide the potatoes into 10 equal portions.
1. Take one portion of mashed potato in the palm of your hand, make a well in the center.
1. Place a portion of the fish filling in the potato well, bring the corners of the potato case together and cover the fish stuffing.
1. (It should be a very thin coating of mashed potato over the fish stuffing)Gently shape into elongated croquettes.
1. Keep a plate of flour, a bowl of whisked eggs, and a plate of bread crumbs are ready, Roll the croquettes over flour, and dip into whipped egg and roll over breadcrumbs.
1. Keep aside in the refrigerator to set, for about 30 minutes or more is good enough.
