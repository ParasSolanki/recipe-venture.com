### Instructions

1. To begin making the French Fruit Cake (Gateaux) recipe, we will first prepare the lemon pound cake according to the instructions.
1.  Preheat the oven to 180 C.
1. Butter and flour a 10" loaf, square, or a bundt pan.
1. I like using a loaf pan as the cake slices nicely.
1. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt and keep aside.
1. Using the large bowl or a KitchenAid Stand Mixer bowl, beat together the (butter) oil, sugar and vanilla essence, add in the eggs (eggless: Flax Eggs) and milk (Vegan: almond milk) and beat until well combined.
1. Finally add in the flour mixture and beat until well combined.
1. Pour the batter into the prepared greased pan and bake until a knife inserted in the centre comes out clean, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
1. The baking time will vary from oven to oven, so take care too look at it after 30 minutes.
1. Allow the cake to cool completely.
1. Bake the pound cake recipe in a round spring foam pan.
1. First, prepare the sugar syrup.
1. Combine all the ingredients for the syrup, stir well until the sugar dissolved.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Next, we will prepare the cream frosting.
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk the cream along with the sugar until it becomes light and fluffy and forms soft peaks.
1. Once the cream forms soft peaks, add in the mascarpone cheese and whisk until just about combined.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Now we will begin to make the cake in layers.
1. Slice the cake horizontally into half.
1. Carefully lift the top later and place it down.
1. Drizzle the sugar juice syrup to both the cake halves.
1. This makes the cake moist and juicy.
1. Place the bottom layer on a cake platter or a serving plate.
1. Using a cake spatula, apply the frosting mixture and spread evenly on the bottom half of the cake.
1. Lay the chopped fruits like kiwi, pineapple, oranges generously on this layer of cream.
1. Next place the second half the cake over the fruits and lightly press it down with your palms.
1. Spread the remaining frosting smoothly with a palate knife or a back of a spoon all round the cake including the sides.
1. Using the back of the spoon, give the cream frosting a little spike by pulling the spoon away from the frosting.
1.  This gives a neat and yet uneven look to the cake.
1. Finally lay the remaining fruits on the top of the cake and just splash the almond slivers to the sides of the cake.
1. The French Gâteaux Recipe (Layered Fruit and Cream Cake) is now ready.
1. Refrigerate the cake for a couple of hours or over night or until the next day for your parties.
