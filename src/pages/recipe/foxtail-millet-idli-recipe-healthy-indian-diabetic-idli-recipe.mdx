### Ingredients

- 1 cup Foxtail Millet.
- 1 teaspoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).
- 1-1/2 cups White Urad Dal (Split).
- Salt - to taste.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Foxtail Millet Idli Recipe, we will wash and soak the millets in water in a separately bowl and urad dal along with methi seeds with enough water in another bowl overnight or keep soaked for at least 8 hours.
1. Soak each of them separately.
1. To make the batter, drain the excess water soaked millets and urad dal.
1. Blend the urad dal along with just enough water to make a thick and very smooth batter.
1. Transfer the batter to a large bowl in which we will set it aside for fermentation along with ground millet.
1. Next blend the foxtail millet with just enough water to make a smooth batter.
1. Add this to the urad dal batter, add 2 teaspoons of salt and stir well to combine.
1. Ferment the batter for 5 to 6 hours or overnight.
1. Once the batter is fermented, gently stir and be careful to not release the air pockets.
1. You can make regular sized idlis or also use the mini idli stand.
1. Grease the idli molds with a little oil and spoon the foxtail millet idli batter into the molds.
1. Prepare the idli steamer with a little water in the bottom.
1. Place the filled idli racks in the steamer.
1. Place the steamer on high heat and steam the idliâ€™s for 10 minutes.
1. After 10 minutes of steaming, turn off the heat.
1. Open the steamer and insert a knife or a pick to test whether the idli's are cooked.
1. If nothing sticks then the idlis are perfectly steamed.
1. Now you can remove the Foxtail millet idli from the steamer.
1. Have a small bowl filled with water.
1. Dip a spoon in the water and then scoop the ragi idli out starting from the edges.
1. Dipping the spoon in water helps in the easy removal of idli from the plates.
1. The wholesome homemade pillow-soft foxtail millet idli is now ready to be served.
1. Serve the Foxtail Millet Mini Idli Recipe along with Thakkali Vengayam Sambar, chutney to enjoy your morning breakfast.
