### Instructions

1. To begin making the Fennel Potato Croquettes with Paneer recipe, we will first get all the ingredients ready.
1. In a bowl, make a dough of the paneer by combining it with a pinch of salt.
1. Divide the paneer into 6 portions and shape them into ovals.
1. In another bowl, combine the remaining ingredients except the dried bread crumbs and the oil.
1.  Combine well, so the potatoes are mashed and well combined.
1. Divide the potato mixture into 6 portions.
1. Oil the palm of your hands, take a portion of the potato and flatten it on the palm.
1. Place a portion of the paneer in the center and cover back with the potato as its cover.
1. Seal it well.
1. Proceed the similar way with the remaining potatoes and the paneer portions.
1. Preheat the airfryer or your oven at 200 C and then proceed to the next steps.
1. Next roll the potatoes on the bread crumbs and coat them well.
1.  If you eat eggs, then first dip the potato croquette into the egg whites then roll through the bread crumbs.
1. Cut the aluminium foil to the size of the air fryer basket.
1. Grease and dust the foil with a little flour so the croquettes donâ€™t stick while getting fried.
1. Pinch its edges of the foil and fit into the basket in such a way that there is some opening for air circulation.
1. Place the croquettes on to the foil and air fry them for 12 to 15 minutes at 200 C.
1. Half way through the process of frying, drizzle 1/8th spoon of oil over each croquette and put it back in again until golden brown.
1. Serve Fennel Potato Croquettes With Paneer Recipe with Roasted Tomato Sauce, Spicy Mexican Salsa Recipe or Creamed Spinach Recipe for an evening snack.
