### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 1 cup Water.
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1 cup Ragi Flour (Finger Millet/ Nagli).
- Rice flour - for dusting.
- Ghee - roasting.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Ragi Ujju Rotti Recipe, in a medium sized vessel, bring the water to a boil in a pan with salt and oil.
1. Lower the flame and pour ragi flour into the boiling water from a cup, pour it in the center of the boiling water.
1. Let it get cooked on a low to medium flame untouched for 8-10 minutes without lid.
1. Turn off the flame, take a wooden stick or a wooden spatula, run it under a tap to wet it and then mix the flour and water mixture vigorously until combined.
1. This step must be done quickly to avoid lumps.
1. This takes about 2 minutes.
1. Cover for a couple of minutes and let it cool until you can handle the mixture.
1. Drop it on an oiled surface and knead well after wetting the hands with water.
1. Moist and freshly washed hands are required since the dough is sticky.
1. Knead for about 5-7 minutes to get rid of lumps if any and to smoothen the pre-cooked flour.
1. Roll the mixture into a cylinder and divide them equally.
1. This should give you about 4 equal sized balls.
1. Keep them covered at all times.
1. Knead each ball for 15-20 seconds and roll it out just like regular ujju rotis using rice flour to dust.
1. Just make sure you do it slow and steady since the edges might crack.
1. Roll out all the balls and stack the roti one on top of another on a plate first and then start roasting them.
1. Use a little rice flour in-between each, to avoid getting stuck to one another.
1. Heat a Tawa and cook the Ujju Roti just like a chapati by smearing oil /ghee on both sides.
1. Cooking will take 1-1.
1. 5 minutes on each side.
1. Serve Karnataka Style Ragi Ujju Roti with Steamed Vegetable in Coconut and Lentil Curry or your favorite chutney like Heerekai Sippe Chutney or Kadale Chutney Recipe.
