### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Butter.
- 1-1/2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1/2 teaspoon Almond essence (Badam Essence).
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 2/3 cup Milk.
- 6 Plums - thinly sliced.
- 3/4 cup Brown Sugar (Demerara Sugar).
- 1/2 teaspoon Orange Zest (Rind).
- 1-1/2 teaspoon Baking powder.
- 2 Whole Eggs.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Skillet Plum Cake Recipe, we will first make the brown butter for the cake.
1. Heat the butter in a small skillet on medium-low heat, stirring continuously.
1.  The butter will begin to froth and will start turning brown after about 3-4 minutes.
1. At this stage turn off the heat and set it aside.
1. To make the batter for the Skillet Plum Cake Recipe, in a mixing bowl, combine the milk, eggs and almond essence, and whisk them together and set aside.
1. In another mixing bowl, combine the all purpose flour, demerara sugar, baking powder, salt.
1. Now add the orange zest and rub it along with the flour using your fingers.
1. This will help the zest release its flavour into the flour.
1. Now pour in the egg-milk mixture into the dry ingredients bowl and whisk until you get a smooth batter.
1. Finally whisk in the brown butter into the fresh plum skillet cake batter.
1. Preheat the oven to 180 degree celsius.
1. Generously grease a 10" skillet with soft butter, and pour the fresh plum skillet cake batter into it.
1. Arrange the sliced plums on the surface of the cake.
1. Place the Skillet Plum Cake in the oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the plum cake comes out clean.
1. Remove from the oven and allow the Skillet Plum Cake Recipe to cool.
1. Serve this warm Skillet Plum Cake Recipe as an evening snack along with Hot Coffee Latte Recipe.
1. You could also serve it as a dessert along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a generous topping of Caramel Sauce.
1. It makes a great dessert idea after a delicious weekend dinner.
