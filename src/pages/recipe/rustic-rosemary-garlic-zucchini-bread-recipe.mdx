### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Sugar.
- 1 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1 1/4 teaspoon Active dry yeast.
- 1/2 tablespoon Rosemary - finely chopped.
- 2 tablespoons Water - to add to the dough.
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower seeds.
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 1/2 cup Green zucchini - shredded.
- 1 tablespoon Garlic - minced.
- 3/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 1/4 cup Lukewarm Water.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rustic Rosemary Garlic Zucchini Bread Recipe, combine spelt bread flour and all purpose flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl.
1. Mix well to combine.
1. To the flour mixture, add the minced garlic, rosemary, shredded zucchini and sunflower seeds.
1. Add little warm water at a time and knead the dough with hand or using an electric mixer with dough hook attachment.
1. Keep kneading until the flour comes together and the dough is smooth, yet firm - slowly until the dough comes clean from the sides of the bowl.
1. Take care when you add water as there will be moisture in the shredded zucchini as well.
1. Dough should come together well at this point; slightly sticky is fine.
1. Place dough ball in well oiled bowl, turning dough a few times so that dough surfaces are protected by oil.
1. Tightly cover bowl with cling wrap.
1. Place in warm, draft-free area to rise until zucchini bread dough is doubled in size.
1. After dough has doubled, divide the dough in two balls and flatten them just a little bit.
1. Sprinkle some rosemary on the top.
1. Place on baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap again and let rest for the second rise.
1. Minutes before the rise period is over, preheat oven to 190 C or 375 F.
1. Using a sharp knife, make surface cuts on the dough to avoid cracking.
1. Bake at 190 C or 375F for 30 to 40 minutes until the top is a nice golden brown, taking care not to over bake.
1. The bread loaves should sound hollow when tapped on the back side.
1. Once done, remove the Zucchini Bread from the oven and immediately brush with butter.
1. Let the butter melt softening the crust.
1. Allow them to cool completely on a wire rack.
1. Serve the Rustic Rosemary Garlic Zucchini Bread along with Pasta In Roasted Red Pepper Sauce for weekend dinner.
