### Ingredients

- 3 Potatoes (Aloo) - peeled cut into barrel shape.
- Salt - to taste.
- 3 cloves Garlic - slit it from between.
- 50 grams Butter.
- 2 sprig Fresh Thyme leaves.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Fondant Potatoes recipes, heat the butter over the medium heat in a sauce pan.
1. When the butter starts foaming, add the potatoes and fry until deep golden brown on one side for 5 to 6 minutes.
1. Turn over the potatoes and cook for further 5 to 6 minutes or until they turn golden-brown on both sides.
1. You can also optionally cover the pan, so the steam makes the potatoes cook faster and they will get roasted at the same time.
1. Add garlic, cloves and fresh thyme in the butter.
1. Sprinkle a dash of salt and oregano flakes.
1. Flip again gently to avoid breaking of the potatoes.
1. Place them on an absorbent paper to absorb the extra butter and serve it hot.
1. Serve Fondant Potatoes with Cottage Cheese Dip Recipe with Pepper and Olives or Low Fat Vegetable Dip Recipe with Herbs of your choice to serve as a snack.
