- Sunflower Oil - for deep frying.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1-1/2 cups Green peas (Matar) - steamed and mashed.
- 1 teaspoon Green Chilli Sauce.
- 1/2 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- 1/4 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 2 teaspoon All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.
- 1/4 cup Water.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon Powder (Dalchini).
- 2 teaspoon Amchur (Dry Mango Powder).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Matar Samosa Recipe first, mix together half a teaspoon of salt into the flour.
1. Rub ghee or vegetable shortening into the flour mixture, with your fingers until it resembles loose bread crumbs.
1. Gradually add water, slowly, and knead to make a soft but firm dough.
1. Roll the dough into a ball, cover with a moist muslin cloth and keep aside.
1. The next step is to make the filling.
1. In a kadai or heavy bottomed pan, warm the ghee, add the jeera and allow it to crackle and tip in the chilli paste.
1. Saute these together for a minute.
1. Add peas followed by all the other spices and cook till the pea mixture becomes dry and all the water has dried up.
1. Season with salt and cook again for 2-3 minutes.
1. Set the peas mixture aside to cool down so it is easier to handle when shaping the samosas.
1. Make a flour paste, by combining the flour and water.
1. To begin making the samosa cases, divide the dough into small balls and roll them into thin circles.
1. Cut each rolled-out circle into two halves by running your knife down the center, so you have 2 semi-circles for each disc.
1. Roll the semi-circles into cones and using a teaspoon fill them with the peas mixture.
1. Dab the flour paste along the edges of the open side of the cone, press the two edges together and seal.
1. Arrange the matar samosas in a platter and cover them with a moist muslin cloth.
1. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai on medium heat.
1. Deep fry the matar samosas in hot oil till they are golden brown.
1. Try not to fry too many together as it will crowd the kadai and alter the cooking time.
1. Remove the Matar Samosa from the kadai using a slotted spoon and drain them on kitchen paper.
1. Matar Samosa  can be served with a dollop of Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and khajoor imli chutney or tomato ketchup, along with masala chai in the evening.
