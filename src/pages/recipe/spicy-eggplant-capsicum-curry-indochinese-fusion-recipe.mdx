### Instructions

1. To prepare Spicy Eggplant & Capsicum Curry (Indo-Chinese Fusion Recipe), heat a large wok/kadai, take 2 tablespoons of the sesame oil (or olive oil), and sauté the cut eggplant and green pepper for about 10 minutes until they become just a little soft.
1. Lightly salt it - don't put too much salt as the soy sauce will also be salty.
1. Care should be taken that the vegetables don't get overcooked as it's nice to have a little crunch to the vegetables.
1. Once done, remove and set aside on a plate.
1. In the same pan (so that the flavor is retained), take the remaining 2 tablespoons of sesame oil and lightly sauté the cut garlic and onions.
1. While these are sautéing, take a bowl and in it mix the soy sauce, chili garlic paste, hoisin sauce, vinegar, water, and cornflour.
1. Beat the mixture so that there are no lumps.
1. Pour this mixture into the wok with the garlic & onions.
1. Now add the eggplant and peppers that you set aside and let the whole things come to a boil.
1. The sauce should start thickening and coating the vegetables.
1. Taste to make sure salt and spice to your desired level.
1. If you need more, add salt and / or chili garlic paste to your level of satisfaction.
1. Garnish with cilantro.
1. It will look gorgeous! You can also optionally sprinkle some roasted peanuts (whole, deskinned) to get a crunchy texture to the food.
1. Serve Spicy Eggplant & Capsicum Curry with white rice or brown rice, or as a wrap with lettuce leaves.
1. It can also be served with Indian Breads like Butter naan or Roti.
