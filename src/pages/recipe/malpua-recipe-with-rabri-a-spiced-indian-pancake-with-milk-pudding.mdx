### Instructions

1. To begin making Malpua Recipe, first prepare the batter.
1. To do this, in a mixing bowl mix stir together the flour, sugar, milk powder, crushed cardamom pods and fennel seeds.
1. Now add the khoya and yogurt in the flour mixture.
1. Stir and mix well to combine.
1. Using a little water at a time, mix continuously until the batter forms a thick flowing consistency without lumps.
1. It should flow like dosa batter.
1. Set it aside so the batter can rest for 30 minutes.
1. Meanwhile prepare the sugar syrup in which you will soak the malpua.
1. To do this, add sugar and water in a heavy bottom saucepan.
1. Set it on a low heat and let it simmer until the sugar has melted completely.
1. Once sugar is dissolved add the lemon juice and saffron strands.
1. Stir once to combine.
1. By now, the sugar syrup should have reached one-string consistency.
1. You will know this, when you touch the sugar syrup between your fingers, it will be sticky.
1. While the sugar syrup is simmering, heat 2 - 3 tablespoon of ghee in a non stick skillet over medium heat.
1. Mix baking soda in the batter and stir to evenly combine.
1. Pour a spoonful of batter on the pan and gently spread with the back of the spoon to form a small sized pancake-like round.
1. Fry the malpua on a low to medium till crisp and golden on both sides.
1. When they're golden and ready to be taken off the skillet, take them off heat and immediately soak them in the warm sugar syrup, either by dipping them in or pouring the sugar over the malpuas.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining Malpuas.
1. Serve Malpua With Rabri as a dessert along with Jalebi during the festive season.
