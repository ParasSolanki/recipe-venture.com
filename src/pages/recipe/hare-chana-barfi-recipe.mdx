### Ingredients

- 3/4 cup Ghee.
- 200 grams Khoya (Mawa).
- 1 cup Fresh green chickpeas.
- 1/2 cup Mixed nuts - sliced thin + 2 tablespoon extra for garnish.
- 3/4 cup Sugar - powdered.
- 1 tablespoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Hare Chane Ki Burfi Recipe, grind the hare chane in a mixer grinder adding very little water to a smooth paste.
1. Do not add much water; you can use about 1 teaspoon water to help grinding, not more than that.
1. We want a thick, smooth paste.
1. Heat desi ghee in a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Add the ground hare chane paste and cook it on low to medium heat, stirring it constantly for about 15 to 20 minutes until you see the hare chane is getting cooked and changing color, giving out a nice aroma.
1. At this stage, add the crumbled khoya, and keep stirring into the hare chane until the khoya melts and gets well combined into the burfi mixture.
1. Once the khoya has blended well, add the sugar, cardamom powder and thin sliced nuts and mix well.
1. You have to keep on stirring to prevent the mix from changing color to brown or burning.
1. Once the burfi reaches thick consistency and all the ingredients are blended well and the burfi comes of from the sides of the pan, turn off the stove.
1. Grease a plate well with ghee.
1. Transfer the hare chane ki burfi mixture into the greased plate and spread it evenly.
1. Smooth the top and the edges.
1. Sprinkle the extra nuts on top and slightly press, place the burfi in fridge for about 4-6 hours to set.
1. Once Hare Chane Ki Burfi has completely set, cut into desired shape using a sharp knife and serve.
1. You can store these burfis in refrigerator for about a week in air tight container.
1. Serve Hare Chane Ki Burfi as a dessert after your meal of Rajasthani Gatte Ki Sabzi, Phulka and Kachumber Salad for a weekday meal.
