1. Add the butter into the flour mixture.
1. Work the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
1. When you hold the flour together, it should hold tight and when you let it loose, it will fall apart.
1. Sprinkle ice water onto the flour and butter mixture.
1.  Using your hands push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together.
1. Make sure to add little water at a time, as the heat from your hands will melt the butter and help form the dough as well.
1. You can transfer the pie dough on to a work surface and knead the dough until all the flour has come together to form a smooth dough.
1. Once done, wrap the dough in a cling film or a plastic wrap and refrigerate it for a couple of hours.

1. Remove the dough from the refrigerator to start rolling.
1. On a generously floured surface, Divide the dough into two equal parts, gently flatten the ball of the dough with a rolling pin.
1. Starting from the center, roll the dough into a circle about an inch larger than the diameter of the pan that you plan to use.
