### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Rose water - optional.
- 2 tablespoons Pistachios - ground.
- Ghee - to grease palms when rolling ladoos.
- 1 cup Condensed Milk.
- 1 cup Dessicated Coconut - plus a few more tablespoons for rolling.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Coconut Ladoo Stuffed With Pistachios, firstly grind the pistachios into a fine powder, place it in a bowl and set it aside for later use.
1. Next, in a non stick pan, pour the condensed milk and desiccated coconut.
1. Turn the heat down to low and cook it, stirring continuously.
1. In about 5 minutes (or less, sometimes) the mixture will begin to turn thick almost like a dough.
1. If you are adding in the rose syrup, now is the time.
1. Once the mixture reaches dough like consistency, you can stop cooking it.
1. Add rose syrup and mix uniformly.
1. Take the mixture off the heat and let it rest for until cools down a bit and is easier to handle with your bare palms.
1. Grease your palm well with ghee or butter.
1. Pinch a lemon sized coconut ladoo dough mixture and press it well between your palms and then roll it into a rough round ladoo.
1. Flatten the ladoo dough slightly and make an depression in the center with your thumb.
1. Add a teaspoon of ground pistachios to the centre.
1. Roll once again, encasing the ground pistachio inside the coconut laddoo, into perfect rounds.
1. Finally, roll the ladoo in desiccated coconut and set it aside.
1. Repeat until you have used up all the coconut ladoo dough.
1. Serve them immediately or store the laddoos in an airtight box in the fridge for about 2-3 days.
1. Serve Coconut Ladoo Stuffed With Pistachios along with Sabudana Khatti Meethi Namkeen when you have guests over during the festive season, or as an evening snack along with Masala Chai.
