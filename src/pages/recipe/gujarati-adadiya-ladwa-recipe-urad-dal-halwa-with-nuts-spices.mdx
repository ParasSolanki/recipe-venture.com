### Instructions

1. To begin making the Gujarati Adadiya Ladwa Recipe, sieve the flour in a broad flat dish.
1. Sprinkle the lukewarm milk and ghee over the flour a little at a time.
1. With gentle palm pressure of both hands, combine the flour along with the ghee and milk until well combined.
1. The mixture should be such that it should form a lump when you hold it firmly with closed fist.
1. This entire procedure which is called ‘Drabo Devo’ would take about 8 to 10 minutes.
1. Cover it and keep it in a warm place for at least 3 hours.
1. The purpose of this is to let the flour bind well together.
1. After 3 hours have passed, gently crumble the mixture and then sieve it in a medium sized sieve.
1. If you don't have a sieve crumble it between your palms until the mixture feels like coarse crumbs.
1. Keep aside.
1. In a sauce pan add 1 cup of water and prepare sugar syrup of less than 1 thread consistency and keep aside.
1. The purpose of preparing the syrup first is that it cools down before you finally pour it over the hot Adadiya Ladwa mixture.
1. Heat a heavy bottomed sauce pan; add the Adadiya Ladwa crumb mixture and saute on medium heat for about 5 minutes.
1. Stir in the crumbled khoya and continue to saute on low heat.
1. Gradually add a little ghee at a time and keep stirring the mixture until you get a roasted aroma.
1. The mixture you have turned a light golden brown.
1. At this stage add in the chopped nuts, raisins and continue to keep stirring.
1. You will notice that that ghee begins to leave the sides of the pan.
1. Add the crushed edible gum and sauté on low or medium flame till it turns golden brown.
1. Finally add the almonds, pistachios and the rest of the spice powders.
1. Stir all ingredients until well combined and turn off the heat.
1. After about a minute, stir in the sugar syrup to the above ladva mixture.
1. Spread the mixture into a flat dish and allow it to cool completely ( 8 - 10 hours or overnight).
1. After it has cooled completely, stir the mixture once again and check if you need any more additions to suit your taste.
1. Shape the ladva mixture into balls or a desired shape.
1. Garnish with finely sliced badam and pistachios.
1. You can store the Gujarati Adadiya Ladwa for upto a month in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
