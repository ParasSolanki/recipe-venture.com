1. Turn the heat to low and add two balls at a time into the hot ghee and fry these balls until turn golden brown in color.

1. Allow the balls to turn brown gradually.
1. The test is done by breaking a fried ball into half and if you notice it is creamy and not browned then you remember to fry the rest of the balls for a longer period of time; hence maintaining low heat during the frying process of absolutely essential.
1. Once you have finished frying all the balls allow them to cool completely.
1. Once cool, crush them in a food processor to form a coarse powder like bread crumbs.
1. Add the cardamom powder and nutmeg powder to the mixture and combine well.
1. In a small pan combine the jaggery and the other 1/2 cup of ghee on low heat.
1. Once the jaggery melts, turn off the heat.
1. Gradually add the melted ghee jaggery mixture to the wheat crumb mixture and combine well but rubbing it between your hands.
1. Once you feel the mixture is reasonably soft, grease your hands with ghee and using the palm of your hands roll it into two inch diameter balls to make the ladoosPlace the poppy seeds on a platter and roll the churma ladoos on the poppy seeds to coat them evenly.
