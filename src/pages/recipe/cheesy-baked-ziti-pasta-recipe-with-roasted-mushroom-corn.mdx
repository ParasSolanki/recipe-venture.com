### Instructions

1. To begin making the Cheesy Baked Ziti Pasta Recipe with Roasted Mushroom & Corn, we will first cook the ziti pasta.
1. In a saucepan, add water and bring it to a boil.
1. Once the water has boiled, add a teaspoon of salt.
1. Add the ziti pasta to the boiling water and let it cook in the boiling water until it is al dente.
1. This process should take a good 12-15 minutes.
1. Once the pasta has cooked, drain the water and run the cooked ziti pasta under running water to stop the cooking process.
1. Drizzle some oil on top of ziti pasta and make sure to coat all of the pasta with the oil so that the pasta doesn't stick to each other.
1. To roast the vegetables In a shallow frying pan, heat olive on medium high flame, to this add the mushrooms and saute until the mushrooms are cooked through.
1. Next add the boiled corn kernels, salt and stir fry along with the mushrooms.
1. Turn off the flame and set aside.
1. To make the pasta sauce In a heavy bottomed pan, heat the olive oil with heat over medium.
1. Add the onion and garlic and saut√© until the onion has turned transparent.
1. This will take about a minute or so.
1. Once it's cooked through, add the tomato puree, the red chili flakes, salt, sugar, basil leaves and a sprig of rosemary.
1. Add about 2 tablespoons of water to bring it to a sauce like consistency.
1. Bring the pasta sauce to a brisk boil and allow the sauce to slightly thicken.
1. Check the salt and adjust according to taste.
1. Once done, add the cooked ziti pasta, roasted mushrooms and corn and toss well to combine for 3 to 4 minutes until the ziti pasta and the vegetables is well coated with the pasta sauce.
1. Turn off the flame and add half the mozzarella cheese into the pasta and gently mix.
1. Preheat the oven to 180 degree celsius, in order to bake the pasta.
1. Next, neatly spoon the ziti pasta mixture into a large serving dish or just into individually ramekins.
1. Top the baking dish with the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese and sprinkle some dry herbs.
1. Bake this in the oven for about 15 minutes until the cheese on the top has melted.
1. Remove the Baked Ziti Pasta from the oven and serve hot.
1. Serve the Cheesy Baked Ziti Pasta Recipe with Roasted Mushroom & Corn along with Garlic Bread With Herb Butter Recipe, Broccoli Salad Recipe with Roasted Onion & Peppers and a dessert of Eggless Choco Lava Cake Recipe and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
