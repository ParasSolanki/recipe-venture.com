### Instructions

1. To cook the Waffled Falafel and Vegetables Recipe, bring all the ingredients together and keep them ready.
1. Roast Cauliflower and Pumpkin in a 200 degree preheated oven for 20 mins or until roasted (flip once in between).
1. Mix Salad leaves, onions, radish, olives, beets and set aside.
1. Whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, salt and cracked pepper using a fork in a small bowl and drizzle on the salad just before serving.
1. In a small bowl add Tahini, garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper.
1. Whisk until the mixture is homogeneous.
1. Squeeze out the excess water from the sundried tomatoes in hot water (Skip this step if using lemon juice instead).
1. In a food processor, add overnight soaked chickpeas along with soaked and cooked chickpeas, prepared sun-dried tomatoes (or lemon juice), cumin powder, coriander powder, red chillies (or chilli powder), salt, lemon juice, pepper and process into a coarse mixture.
1. To this mixture add the chopped coriander, parsley, chopped onion and minced garlic and gently bring everything together.
1. Set this mixture aside for half an hour so that the chickpeas soak in all the flavours.
1. Now heat the greased waffle iron and make a ball (slightly bigger than a lemon) from the prepared chickpea mixture and press to make the waffled falafel.
1. Plate the waffle with roast vegetable salad and sauce dressing (Tahini dressing can be substituted with beaten yoghurt).
1. Serve this Waffled Falafel and Vegetables with a lemon wedge for an added tang.
1. Serve Waffled Falafels and Vegetables along with Mediterranean Cucumber Salad for a weekend dinner.
