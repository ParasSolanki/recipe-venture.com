### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons Salt.
- 1/2 cup White Urad Dal (Whole).
- 2 teaspoons Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).
- 2 cups Idli Rice.
- 1 cup Poha (Flattened rice).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Karnataka Style Set Dosa Recipe, we will first soak the rice and flattened rice/poha together in one bowl and the urad dal along with the fenugreek seeds in another bowl.
1. Soak them for at least 6 hours.
1. After 6 hours, grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter.
1. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter.
1. The batter will look fluffy.
1. Pour this batter into a large container.
1. Grind the rice and flattened rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter and thick batter.
1. Adding too much water will make the dosa batter too watery.
1. Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments.
1. You will notice the batter would have doubled in volume.
1. Do make sure you place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.
1. Once risen in volume, stir the batter just a little to combine it through.
1. Take care not to stir it vigorously, as it will loose it fluffiness.
1. Heat a skillet over medium heat.
1. You will know its heat just right, when you sprinkle some water over the skillet, it will sizzle.
1. Pour a ladleful of batter over the skillet and allow it to spread on its own (just a bit).
1. The set dosa is like a pancake.
1. It's a little thick and fluffy.
1. Cover the dosa with a lid and allow to cook in its own steam for a few minutes.
1. Once you notice the top is steamed and cooked through, you can remove it from the skillet and serve.
1. Proceed the same way to make the remaining set dosas.
1. Serve the Karnataka Style Set Dosas along with three different types of chutneys like Tomato Onion Chutney, Coconut Coriander Chutney and Ginger Walnut Chutney.
