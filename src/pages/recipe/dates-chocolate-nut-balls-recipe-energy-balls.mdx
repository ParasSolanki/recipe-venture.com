### Ingredients

- 30 Pistachios.
- 30 Badam (Almond).
- 500 grams Dates - seedless.
- 30 Cashew nuts.
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.
- 2 tablespoons Cocoa Powder.
- 1/4 cup Sesame seeds (Til seeds) - roasted (or cocoa powder or coconut).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Dates Choco Balls Recipe, first grind the seedless dates in a food processor or your mixer.
1. Grind the dates to a fine paste without adding any water.
1. Next, chop the cashew nuts, almonds and pistachios into small pieces and keep them aside until later use.
1. In a non-stick flat bottom pan heat 1/2 tablespoon ghee and roast the nuts on a low-medium heat.
1. Take care to roast them gently so they turn golden and aromatic, but not burn.
1. Take them out of the ghee and set them aside.
1. In the same pan heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of ghee and add the ground date paste and saute it for 2-3 minutes.
1. Then, take it off the heat.
1. Now add the roasted cashew nuts, almonds, pistachios, along with the cocoa powder, to the date mixture and combine it all.
1. Allow the mixture to cool down.
1. Once it is cool enough to handle, shape of your choice.
1. You can roll the date chocolate mixture into lemon-sized balls for convenience.
1. Then, roll them over sesame seeds, or coconut or even cocoa powder and store refrigerated for a couple of weeks.
1. Making the Date Chocolate Balls bite-sized makes it convenient to carry when travelling too, or to gift them for the festivals like Diwali.
1. You can also pop them into lunch boxes, snack on them after exercise and use them to satisfy your sweet cravings too.
