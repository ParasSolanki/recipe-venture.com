1. Release the pressure naturally, and then remove the cinnamon sticks and mash it coarsely.
1. Transfer to a bowl with milk and sugar, whisk it thoroughly till it is combined and keep it aside.
1. Now heat a pan with a dollop of butter, as the butter melts, add the cut bread and toast it till it light brown and keep it aside.
1. Next is to make the crumb topping, in a bowl add all-purpose flour, brown sugar, cinnamon powder, unsalted butter, walnuts, and mix it thoroughly and keep it aside.
1. It is the time to assemble the French toast so in order to do that, we need a flat casserole, grease it with oil or butter.
1. Add the toasted bread cubes, then pour in the pumpkin mixture, and then add few dollops of cream cheese and spread it evenly.
1. At the end, spread over the crumb topping evenly and bake it in the oven for 30 minutes at 180 degree Celsius.
