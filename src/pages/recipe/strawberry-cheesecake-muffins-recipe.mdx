1. Keep the cream cheese batter aside.
1. In a mixing bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and salt, keep aside.

1. In a separate bowl, beat together egg, milk, rest of the sugar (1/2 cup), butter and vanilla extract.
1. Gradually add the flour mixture and beat until the cake is well combined.
1. Add the remaining strawberries into the cake mixture and fold it in.
1. Preheat the oven to 180 C and grease the muffin pan or line it with muffins paper.
1. Spoon half the cake batter into the bottom of the pan.
1. Next, spoon the cream cheese batter on the top and another spoon of the cake batter.
1. Essentially the cream cheese batter is sandwiched between the cake batter.
1. Once done, place the Strawberry Cheesecake Muffin in the oven and set it to bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until a tester inserted inside comes out almost clean.

1. Once cooled, the Strawberry Cheesecake Muffins are ready to be served during tea time or as a dessert.
