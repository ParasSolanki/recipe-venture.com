### Instructions

1. To begin making Stuffed Arbi Paratha Recipe, we will make the paratha dough.
1. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.
1. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.
1. Add little water at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough.
1. Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
1. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.
1. Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead little more.
1. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.
1. Divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions.
1. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you get the filling ready.
1. Pressure cook arbi with 1 cup water and salt for around 4 whistle and switch off the heat.
1. Once it is pressure cooked, allow the pressure to release naturally and peel the skin.
1. Mash the arbi into a coarse lumpy texture with your fingers or a fork.
1. Once mashed, add in the finely chopped green chillies, lots of freshly chopped coriander leaves,  salt to taste, half teaspoon of cumin powder, half a teaspoon of coriander powder, a teaspoon of dry mango powder, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder and finally if you want it extra spicy, the red chilli powder.
1. Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients into the arbi until well combined.
1. Divide the arbi filling into 8 to 10 equal portions.
1. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of arbi paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.
1. The final step is to stuff the filling into the arbi paratha dough.
1. We dust the paratha dough in flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface.
1. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter circle.
1. Take a portion of filling and place it in the center.
1. Next Gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together.
1. Remove the little excess dough which popped out when you brought them together.
1. Press the filled arbi paratha dough down.
1. Dust the filled arbi paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying just a pressure.
1. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.
1. Preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled arbi paratha.
1. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.
1. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around.
1. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet.
1. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.
1. Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly.
1. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the arbi parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.
1. Once the arbi paratha is cooked transfer to a plate.
1. Continue to the same process with the remaining parathas the same way.
1. Serve the Stuffed Arbi Paratha Recipe along with Palak Raita Recipe and Amla Mirchi Ka Achari Subzi Recipe by the side to make it a healthy breakfast.
