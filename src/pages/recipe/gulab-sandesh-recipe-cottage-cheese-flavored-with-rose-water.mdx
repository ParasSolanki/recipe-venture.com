### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Sugar - powdered.
- 350 grams Chenna (Homemade Cottage Cheese).
- Fresh rose petals - for garnishing (optional).
- 1 teaspoon Rose water.
- 1/4 cup Pistachios - sliced.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Gulab Sandesh Recipe, make the homemade paneer/ chenna according to the instructions.
1. Once all the water from the chenna is drained, place the chenna in a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the sugar and gulab jal (rose water).
1. Using the heel of your hands, knead the chenna to make a very soft and smooth mixture.
1. This process takes at least 10 minutes to get a really soft and smooth chenna sandesh mixture.
1. Once you notice you have a smooth ball of sandesh dough, divide the sandesh into equal portions and shape them into tiny bite size balls.
1. Roll them between the palms of your hand and shape them into smooth balls.
1. Using your thumb make an impression in the center.
1. Place a sliced pistachio or a fresh rose petal in the center and the Gulab Sandesh is ready to be served.
1. Serve the Gulab Sandesh with a warm cup of Tetley Cinnamon and Honey Green Tea that compliments and balances out the sweetness of the sandesh.
