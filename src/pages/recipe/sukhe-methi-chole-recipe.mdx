### Instructions

1. To begin making the Sukhe Methi Chole Recipe, wash and soak the kabuli chana, overnight.
1. Next morning, add the kabuli chana along with a cup of water and some salt into the pressure cooker, close the lid and pressure cook for about 7-8 whistles for about 30 minutes.
1. Reduce the flame, and simmer for another 10 minutes, before you switch off the flame.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure has released, drain the excess water and set the boiled kabuli chana aside.
1. In a kadai, heat ghee on medium flame, to the hot ghee, add cumin seeds and bay leaf and allow them to sizzle.
1. Next add the ginger, garlic and green chilli and saute for about a minute.
1. To this add the onion and saute for a couple of minutes, or until the onions turn transparent.
1. Once the onions have softened and changed colour, add in the salt, and turmeric powder and tomatoes, sprinkle some water and cover with a lid.
1. Cover and cook until the tomatoes turn mushy.
1. This will take a good 2-3 minutes on medium-high flame.
1. Now open the lid and mix well to bring the onion tomato mixture together.
1. At this stage add the washed and chopped fenugreek leaves and allow it to wilt down.
1. After a couple of minutes, you will see the methi leaves are well combined into the onion-tomato mixture.
1. Finally add in the dry spice powders - red chilli powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder and boiled chole and give the Sukhe Methi Chole a good stir.
1. Stir fry the Sukhe Methi Chole for another 3 to 4 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Check the salt and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Once done, transfer the Sukhe Methi Chole to a serving bowl and serve hot.
