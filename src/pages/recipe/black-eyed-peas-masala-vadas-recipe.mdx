### Instructions

1. To begin making the Black Eyed Peas Masala Vadas recipe, strain the water from the lobhia using a colander and pat dry to remove as much moisture as possible.
1. In a mixer jar add green chillies, ginger, salt, asafoetida and 2 tablespoons of the lobhia and grind and add this into a mixing bowl.
1. Now add the remaining Lobhia into the mixer jar and grind coarsely, add to the mixing bowl.
1. Squeeze out extra moisture from the crushed corn and add it into the mixing bowl.
1. Add all the remaining ingredients into the mixing bowl.
1. Combine everything and taste to adjust seasoning.
1. Shape the mixture into vadas and deep fry until golden in a deep fry pan.
1. Make sure to cook on a medium to high flame so that its cooked through.
1. If the vada mixture is very moist it could absorb lots of oil, the trick is to pat the vadas on a clean dry towel so it absorbs excess moisture.
1. Then transfer them to your hands and drop them gently into the oil to fry, this way you will get crispy non greasy vadas.
1. Serve Black Eyed Peas Masala Vadas with South Indian Coconut Chutney or Tomato Garlic Chutney on a rainy day.
