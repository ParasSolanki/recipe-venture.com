- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 3 Potatoes (Aloo) - boiled.

### Instructions

1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Add the finely chopped onion and saute until it turns soft and translucent - about a minute.
1. Once the onions are softened, add bhindi,  sprinkle some salt and saute until the sliminess goes away.
1.  Keep the bhindi slightly covered, this will help the bhindi cook faster with the steam.
1. At the same time, since the lid is slightly ajar, it will help the steam escape and prevent sliminess.
1. Once the bhindi is cooked, add the boiled potatoes, turmeric powder and powdered black peppercorns and cumin powder and saute till the Kali Mirch Aloo Bhindi Sabzi turns a bit crispy.
1. This would take about 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Check the salt and adjust accordingly.
1. Once the Aloo Bhindi turns a bit crispy and gets well coated with the cumin-pepper powder turn off the heat and serve hot.
1. Serve the Kali Mirch Aloo Bhindi Sabzi along with Steamed Rice, Garlic Rasam, Elai Vadam and Carrot Cucumber Tomato Salad with Lemon and Coriander Recipe for a simple yet flavoursome weeknight dinner.
