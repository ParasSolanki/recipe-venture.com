### Instructions

1. To begin making the Palak Onion Kadhi Pakora Recipe, we will make the pakoras first.
1. *Method for Pakora'sCombine all the ingredients for the palak pakora in a large bowl.
1. Add very little water to make a thick batter.
1. Heat the kuzhi paniyaram pan on medium heat; add a teaspoon of oil into each of the cavities and drop a spoon of the pakora batter into the cavity.
1. Cover the pan and steam cook the pakora's until you notice the top has steamed.
1. Once the top has steamed, flip them over to cook on the other side.
1. Continue to cook on medium heat until the pakoras has cooked through from the inside and have a golden brown color.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining pakora batter and keep them aside.
1. *Method for the Punjabi KadhiWhisk the yogurt, gram flour, water, asafoetida, chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder and salt until well blended.
1. Add the water and whisk more until well blended.
1. Place the kadhi in a saucepan, on medium high heat and allow it to come to a brisk boil.
1. Keep whisking it continuously while it is on heat, as this will help the yogurt and the spices along with gram flour come together into a creamy texture.
1. Allow the kadhi to boil briskly for about 3 to 4 minutes, then turn the heat to low and simmer for another 5 minutes.
1. The simmering process helps the kadhi get the flavors of the spices and the gram flour.
1. It will thicken slightly and attain a smooth creamy consistency and it will have a shine to it.
1. Towards the end of the simmering process, add in the spinach pakora's.
1. We will proceed to make the seasoning for the Khadi.
1. Heat ghee in a large sauce pan; add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, cinnamon stick and the whole red chillies.
1. Allow them to crackle.
1. Add the onions and ginger and saute until onions turn golden and tender.
1. Finally, stir in the curry leaves and pour the seasoning mixture into the simmering Kadhi.
1. Note: The Kadhi will thicken as the Pakora simmers in the yogurt curry, so once again adjust the thickness by adding little or more water as required and adjust to the consistency you like.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Transfer the Palak Kadhi Pakora to the serving bowl.
1. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.
1. Serve the Palak Onion Kadhi Pakora along with Phulka, Bhindi Masala Recipe (Bhindi Tamatar Ki Sabzi) and Bean Sprout & Corn Salad Recipe.
