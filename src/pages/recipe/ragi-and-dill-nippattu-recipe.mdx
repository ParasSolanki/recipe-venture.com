### Instructions

1. To begin making the Ragi And Dill Nippattu, dry roast the flours until aromatic for about 4 to 6 minutes on medium heat.
1. turn off the heat and cool it completely.
1. Mix all the ragi flour, rice flour, gram flour, chili flakes, cumin, sesame, dill and salt together.
1. Pour a tablespoon of sizzling hot melted butter in the mixture and mix thoroughly.
1. Now add lukewarm water little by little and mix into a soft and pliable dough.
1. Make little balls and roll them flat into little discs, about 2 inches in diameter.
1. You can grease a plastic sheet, or use wax paper to pat down the nippattu.
1. Heat oil in a deep fry pan on medium-high.
1. When the oil starts to smoke, add a tiny ball of dough; if it sizzles and rises to the oil surface, the oil is hot enough.
1. Reduce the heat to medium; gently peel away the nippattus from the wax paper and lower them into the oil.
1. They will sink, and foam at first, then come up to the surface quickly.
1. Flip them over to the other side and fry till golden brown.
1. Once done transfer the Ragi and Dill Nippattu onto an oil absorbent paper.
1. When the Ragi And Dill Nippattu are completely cool, store them in airtight boxes in a cool dark place.
1. Serve Ragi And Dill Nippattu with hot Masala Chai during your tea time break.
