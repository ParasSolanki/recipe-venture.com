### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- Salt - to taste.
- 10 Potatoes (Aloo) - small size but not baby potatoes.
- 1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- 2 tablespoons Sunflower Oil - or butter.
- 2 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 1/2 teaspoon Amchur (Dry Mango Powder) - or Juice of 1 lemon.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Tuk Patata or Aloo Took Recipe, first we need to thoroughly clean the potatoes under running water.
1. Next, peel them and place them in a heavy bottomed pot, with enough water to submerge them completely.
1. To parboil them, add a dash of salt to it, and place the pot on the heat.
1. Bring the water to a boil and then simmer for about 7-10 minutes until the potatoes are slightly softened by cooking.
1. They should not be soft enough to mash, but cooked enough to allow a knife to be poked through them.
1. Meanwhile, set your oven to preheat at 180 degrees C.
1. Once the potatoes are parboiled, drain them from the water and transfer them potatoes onto a baking tray.
1. Drizzle the oil or add the butter and toss the potatoes thoroughly so they are coated well.
1. Place them in the oven to bake for 30 minutes.
1. After 30 minutes, remove the tray from the oven and allow the potatoes to cool slightly, for about 10 minutes.
1. Meanwhile do not turn the oven off, allow it to remain heating.
1. Then, using a potato masher or the back of a flat-ish spoon/ladle, press each potatoes gently/lightly to roughly break open the potato and slightly flatten it.
1. Take care not to flatten it too much or the potatoes will disintegrate.
1. They should be open, but hold together.
1. Once you have flattened all the potatoes, generously sprinkle the spice powders along with some salt all over the potatoes and toss gently, to avoid the potatoes from falling apart.
1. Once again, bake them for 30 minutes or till the potatoes are golden brown and crisp.
1. Flip them once in between.
1. When done, remove them from the oven, adjust seasoning if required, sprinkle Amchur powder or squeeze lemon juice over it.
1. Serve the Tuk Patata or Aloo Took hot along with North Indian Style Dal or Kadhi and Rice for a delicious, simple meal.
1. You can also serve it as a tea-time snack with Pudina Chutney and Masala Chai for a tea time indulgence.
