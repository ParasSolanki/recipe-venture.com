1. *For the Basundi/Rabri To begin making the Basundi Recipe, we will first have to condense the milk.
1. To do this, place the milk on high heat over a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring it boil.
1. Add the sugar and stir continuously until the sugar dissolves.
1. Once the sugar has dissolved and the milk is boiling vigorously for a few minutes reduce the heat to low and simmer the milk mixture stirring continuously until it is reduced to three fourths of its original quantity.
1. The condensation will cause the cream from the milk to settle on the sides and bottom of the pan.
1. Its important to keep scraping down the cream and adding it back to the condensing milk.
1. The mixture will begin to thicken and get a creamy texture.
1. It is important to make sure towards the end of the condensing process to be close to the stove monitoring the milk and stirring it continuously.
1. The last stages are when the condensed milk can get burned at the bottom of the pan and completely alter the taste of the basundi.
1. Note Again: During the process of condensation of the milk, keep stirring the cream that keep forms, as it will stick to the sides and bottom of of them pan, while stirring keep scrapping down the sides and bottom to prevent burning of the cream.
1. Once the milk has reduced to half of its original quantity, turn off the heat.
