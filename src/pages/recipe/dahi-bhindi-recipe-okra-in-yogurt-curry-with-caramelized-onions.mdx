- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- Sunflower Oil - for cooking.
- 1 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 tablespoon Caramelized onions.
- 1 inch Ginger - grated.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- 200 grams Bhindi (Lady Finger/Okra) - cut into 1 inch pieces.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Dahi Bhindi Recipe, we will first roast the Bhindi .
1. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a Wok or a Kadai; add the chopped onions and the bhindi (okra).
1. Sprinkle some salt and saut√© the bhindi and the onions on low heat.
1. Keep the pan covered for the few minutes so the bhindi gets cooked.
1. When covered the bhindi releases moisture, but this moisture helps it to cook and soften as well.
1. Once you notice that it has released a little moisture and the bhindi is slightly softened, open the pan and stir fry the bhindi until it is well roasted.
1. Make sure you roast it on medium heat.
1. Roast the Bhindi until you notice it has begun to shrink and has browned.
1. It should not become sticky, slimy and gooey.
1. If it has turned this way, add a little more oil and sprinkle some gram flour/besan and stir it gently.
1. This will absorb the sliminess.
1. The bhindi is a tricky vegetable to cook, so it takes some practice to not making it gooey.
1. Once the bhindi is cooked and well roasted, keep it aside till we prepare the yogurt gravy.
1. To make the Yogurt Curry, add the yogurt into a saucepan; add the gram flour, grated ginger, garam masala powder,  turmeric powder and chili powder.
1. Whisk until smooth.
1. Add in 1/4 cup of water and whisk again until well combined.
1. Place the saucepan on a medium heat and allow the yogurt mixture to come to a brisk boil.
1. Allow it to boil for a couple of minutes and then turn the heat to low.
1. Simmer the mixture until the yogurt becomes thick and creamy.
1. Once thick and creamy, add in the roasted bhindi and stir.
1. Simmer for a few more minutes.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Turn off the heat and transfer the Dahi Bhindi a serving bowl.
1. The final step is to make the seasoning.
1. Heat a tablespoon of ghee in a Tadka Pan.
1. Add the cumin seeds, dry red chilies and roast them until lightly browned.
1. Pour this seasoning and the caramelized onions into the Dahi Bhindi.
1. Stir to mix gently and finally stir in the chopped coriander leaves.
1. Serve the Dahi Bhindi along with Phulka Recipe  or Steamed Rice and  Green Moong Sprout Salad for a simple weeknight dinner or even a weekend lunch.
