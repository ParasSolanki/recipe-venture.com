### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pesarattu Upma Recipe will first soak the green moong dal and rice together in water for at least 3 hours.
1.  After 3 hours drain the water.
1. Blend the dal, green chillies and ginger by adding little water at a time to make a smooth thick batter.
1. Transfer the batter into a large bowl, add onions, salt and coriander leaves.
1. Stir well to combine the Pesarattu batter well.
1. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. In a saucepan, bring the 3 cups of water, salt and sugar to a brisk boil.
1. After it comes to a brisk boil, turn the heat to low to keep the water warm.
1.  Our next step is to make the upma, roast the sooji in a cast iron pan and roast them till it slightly changes its colour.
1. Keep it aside.
1. Heat oil/ghee in a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Add the mustard seeds, urad dal and allow it to crackle and the urad dal to turn golden brown.
1. Stir in the asafoetida and curry leaves.
1. Next, add the onions, green chillies and ginger and cook till the onion becomes soft and translucent.
1. Next, add the tomatoes and allow it cook till the tomatoes becomes mushy and soft.
1. Finally, add sooji  and gradually add the sugar and salt warm water.
1. Keep stirring until the Upma comes together.
1. Cook for about 5 to 8 minutes until the upma, comes away from the sides of a pan.
1. Once the upma is cooked well, turn off the heat and keep aside.
1. Now to make the Pesarattu.
1. You will need a well-seasoned skillet.
1. Preheat the skillet on medium heat; sprinkle some water to check on the pan; if it sizzles then you know the pan has the right amount of heat to spread the Pesarattu batter.
1. Pour a ladle full of the Pesarattu batter onto the pan and spread evenly inside out to make a circle.
1. Drizzle some oil on the top and the sides of the Pesarattu and allow it to cook on low to medium heat.
1. Once you notice the top of the Pesarattu getting steamed, flip it over to cook on the other side.
1. Once you notice brown spots and the Pesarattu is cooked, flip it back and place a big scoop of the upma to the side and fold it into half and remove from the pan and serve hot.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining Pesarattu batter.
1. Serve the Pesarattu Upma Recipe along with tomato chutney and coconut chutney to make it a rich breakfast meal.
