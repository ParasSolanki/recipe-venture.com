### Instructions

1. To begin the Roasted Potato Wrap/Roll Recipe With Spiced Cheese Spread, first get all the ingredients prepped and ready.
1. It also helps when you have ready rotis and tortillas so you can make these rolls in just 15 minutesTo begin, we will first roast the potatoes in a wok.
1. Heat oil in a wok, add the garlic and allow it to sizzle for a few seconds.
1. Add the bell peppers and saute them until softened just a bit.
1. Once softened add the par boiled potatoes, sprinkle salt and saute on medium high heat until the potatoes are roasted well and cooked through.
1. Once the potatoes are roasted, stir in the oregano and chili sauce and turn off the heat.
1. The next step is to toast the tortillas with a little oil on the pan.
1. Toasting the tortillas gives it a good crunch and taste to the roll, making it extra delicious.
1. Now that the tortilla is toasted itâ€™s time to assemble our Cream Cheese Roasted Potato rolls.
1. Place a roti on a clean dry surface.
1. Spread a tablespoon of Asli Pepper cheese spreadz over the roti.
1. I love the way the cheese spreads beautifully with ease.
1. It makes cooking so much fun.
1. And the best part of the cheese spreadz is that it makes a great high protein replacement for butter.
1. It adds to the creaminess and what more the taste too.
1. Once you have spread the cheese, add the roasted potatoes, capsicum, onions and roll it up tightly.
1. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 3 more rolls.
1. Wrap a parchment paper around each roll and serve immediately.
1. Serve the Roasted Potato Wrap/Roll as a tea time snack with Adrak Chai, and after school snack, or a kids lunch box or even a quick weeknight dinner.
