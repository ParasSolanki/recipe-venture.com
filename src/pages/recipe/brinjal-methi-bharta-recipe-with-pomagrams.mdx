### Instructions

1. To begin making this recipe, we will first saute the chopped methi leaves.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a pan, add the chopped methi leaves and stir fry it on medium heat until you notice the leaves shrink and soften.
1. The methi leaves will also give out a lot of water.
1. Evaporate most of the moisture by turn the heat to high for a few minutes.
1. Once most of the water is evaporated, turn off the heat and keep the methi aside.
1. The next step is to make the Baingan Bharta.
1. For this, the  brinjal can be roasted in two ways; in the oven or on the gas flame.
1. Method using the oven for roasting : Preheat the oven to 180 C.
1. Place the brinjal on a baking sheet and place in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until the brinjal has started to soften and the outer skin is charred.
1. When you prick inside with a knife, you can feel that the brinjal has become tender, if not continue to roast until done.
1. Method using the flame for roasting: Place the brinjal on the stove top flame, with continuous monitoring, using tongs to turn the brinjal around while it is roasting.
1. After about 10 minutes you will notice that the brinjal’s skin begins to char and the inside begins to get tender.
1. To test, when you insert a knife you will feel it is soft and not hard.
1. If hard continue to roast until done.
1. Once brinjal is roasted allow the brinjal to cool down.
1. Peel the charred skin of the cooled brinjal and discard the skin.
1. Coarsely mash the pulp using a fork or mince finely using a knife.
1. Heat oil in a pan over medium high heat.
1. Add the cumin seeds and allow seeds to crackle.
1. Add the grated ginger and chopped onions, sauté over medium heat until the onions are tender.
1. Then add the grated tomatoes, turmeric powder, green chillies, coriander powder, garam masala powder and chilli powder.
1. Stir to combine and sauté until all the ingredients come together for about couple of minutes.
1. Stir in the roasted brinjal, butter and salt.
1. Turn the heat to low and simmer the brinjal for about 10 minutes or so until it gets well combined with the tomatoes and spices.
1. Turn off the heat and stir in the sauteed methi leaves.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
