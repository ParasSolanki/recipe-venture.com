### Instructions

1. Method for Paneer Kofta'sCombine all the ingredients for the koftas in a bowl and knead well until you can get dough of the paneer.
1. The dough will be firm and yet soft enough to shape into balls.
1. Our next step is to bake them or pan fry them in the kuzhi paniyaram pan.
1. Oven MethodIf you plan to bake the kofta's; then place the paneer balls on a greased baking sheet.
1. Brush the paneer balls with some oil and bake in a preheated oven (200 C) until the koftas turn golden brown in colour.
1. Remove the kofta's from the oven once baked and keep them aside.
1. Kuzhipaniyaram Pan MethodIf you plan to use the kuzhi paniyaram pan; then place the kofta balls in the pan's cavities; drizzle the kofta's with a little oil and pan fry them until golden brown on both sides.
1. You will have to flip the kofta balls so they fry on all sides evenly.
1. Once you are done baking/ pan frying the kofta's we will proceed to make the curry base.
1. Method for the Kofta CurryHeat oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add in the grated ginger and the honey, saut√© until the honey begins to bubble.
1. Stir in the tomato puree, turmeric powder, cardamom powder, garam masala powder, salt and chilli powder to taste.
1. Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for a couple of minutes till the tomatoes get cooked through.
1. Finally add in the cream and the kasuri methi and stir it into the kofta curry.
1. Add in the pan fried/baked Paneer Kofta Balls into the curry, cover the pan and simmer until the curry and flavours get absorbed into the koftas.
1. Do make sure to check the salt and spice levels and adjust according to your taste.
