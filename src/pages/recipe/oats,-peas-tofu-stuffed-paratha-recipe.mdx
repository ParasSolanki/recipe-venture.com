### Instructions

1. To begin making the Oats, Peas & Tofu Stuffed Paratha Recipe we will first prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. We will first knead the dough for the paratha.
1. In a large mixing bowl, add the flour and salt.
1. Add water little at a time and knead to make a soft and smooth dough.
1. Once all the flour has come together, drizzle a teaspoon of oil on the top of the dough and knead for another couple of minutes.
1. Cover the dough and keep aside.
1. We will now proceed to make the stuffing.
1. Heat a skillet on a medium heat with some oil, add in the garlic and ginger, saute them well.
1. Then add in the chopped onion, green chillies, bell peppers and peas.
1. Saute them till it is half cooked.
1.     Add in the crumbled tofu, soaked oats and all the spice powders, cook them well on the medium heat till the raw smell of the spice goes away.
1. Keep it aside.
1. Divide the dough portions into medium lemon size balls.
1. Place some flour aside for dusting.
1. Pat the portion of the dough and dust it in flour.
1. Roll out the dough into a 5 inch diameter circle.
1. Spoon a large portion of the filling in the center of the circle.
1. Bring the edges of the circle to the center, pinch and seal gently.
1. Lightly flatten the dough again with your palm.
1. Roll the paratha, adding very little pressure so the filling stays inside and does not ooze out.
1. Proceed the same way to fill the remaining Oats, Peas & Tofu Stuffed  Paratha.
1. The next step is to cook the paratha on the skillet or roti tawa.
1. Preheat the skillet and then place the rolled out paratha on the skillet.
1. Flip and cook on both sides until brown spots appear and the paratha is fully cooked.
1. Drizzle ghee or oil on the paratha and cook on low to medium heat until the paratha is cooked through and golden brown on both sides.
1. Once cooked, transfer the paratha to a platter and cook the remaining Oats, Peas & Tofu Stuffed  Parathas the similar way.
1. Serve the Oats, Peas & Tofu Stuffed Paratha Recipe along with Garlic yogurt or just a pickle by the side to relish your breakfast meal or Lunch.
