1. Eventually, you will get a sticky dough, after about 5 minutes.
1. Now grease your hands with some oil and on a flat surface, start kneading the dough.

1. Mix everything properly so that the oil is coated evenly.
1. After 90 minutes, the dough will be doubled.
1. If not, wait for another 30 minutes.
1. Punch the dough down and knead again for about half a minute.
1. Make 3 balls of equal size.
1. Oil your hands and start flattening one of the balls and pulling it in the round and place it in the center of the pan.
1. Now use your fingers to push through the edges and evening out each pizza base.
1. Top each pizza base with pizza sauce, sprinkle cheese, arrange onions, bell peppers and tomatoes and top it up with cheese again.
1. Cook the pan pizza for 10-12 minutes or until done.
