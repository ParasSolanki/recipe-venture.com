### Instructions

1. You will need approximately 3/4 to 1 cup of water.
1. Heat a pan/kadai and add ghee.
1. Do the tempering of mustard, urad dal, green chillies, ginger, asafoetida and curry leaves.
1. Allow the urad dal to turn golden brown and crisp.
1. Transfer the Ragi Pachchai Maa Puli Upma batter to the pan with the tempering and cook till it absorbs all the moisture and becomes grainy and little crispy.
1. Cook on medium heat.
1. It takes about 3 to 4 minutes for it to become grainy and cooked.
1. If you feel the Ragi Puli Upma is too dry, you can sprinkle some water and cook it further.
1. Keep the pan covered and mix a couple of times in between and serve the Pachchai Maa Puli Upma immediately.
