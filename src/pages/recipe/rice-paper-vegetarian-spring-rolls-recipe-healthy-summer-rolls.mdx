### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rice Paper Vegetarian Spring Rolls Recipe, we will first prepare the vegetables for the filling.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a wok; stir-fry the mushrooms until softened and most of the moisture is evaporated.
1. Once cooked through, turn off the heat and keep aside.
1. Cut the vegetables lengthwise or as mentioned in the ingredient list and place it in a large bowl.
1. Add in the sauteed mushrooms to the vegetables.
1. Whisk together the dressing ingredients and pour it over the cut vegetables and toss well.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Our next step is to soften the rice wrappers to make the cover for the spring rolls.
1. Fill wide a pan with warm water.
1. Immerse each rice wrapper completely into the water and allow it to rest in the water for about 30 seconds.
1. You will notice the wrapper begins to soften.
1. Carefully remove the rice wrapper from the water and spread it on a wooden board.
1. Our next step is to make the spring rolls.
1. Place the filling in the center of the soaked wrapper.
1. Place only a little at a time, as you will need enough place to shape it into a spring roll.
1. To shape the roll, first fold the both the sides of the wrapper over the filling, then roll the wrapper from the bottom towards the top until all the wrapped is rolled through.
1. Lift carefully and arrange the roll on a platter.
1. Continue this process of soaking, filling and shaping the rice wrappers and arrange them on the serving platter and cover with a damp muslin cloth.
1. If you plan to serve them later, cover the platter with a cling wrap so the rice paper spring rolls don't dry out.
1. Once you are ready to serve, remove the cling film, slice the Vegetarian Rice Paper Spring Rolls into half and serve it along with Peanut Chilli Dipping Sauce.
