### Instructions

1. To begin making Osmania Biscuits Recipe, line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
1. Sift the all purpose flour with baking powder and salt in a bowl.
1. Cream the butter using a silicon or rubber spatula until softened.
1. Incorporate the sifted flour mixture very little at a time to the creamed butter without any lumps.
1. You can use your fingers to ease the process but not the heel of your palm as it is warmer than the fingers by which the butter can melt and disturb its texture.
1. Once all the flour is mixed in, with light hands knead or massage the mixture in order to incorporate some air.
1. After a couple of minutes the dough turns light and pale.
1. Now add milk powder, soy flour and powdered sugar.
1. Knead them for couple of minutes until well combined.
1. At this point you can refrigerate the dough for few minutes, if its sticking to your hands or else you can continue with the process.
1. Divide the dough into two equal portions.
1. Dust the working surface with little flour and roll out one dough portion into 1/4 inch thick sheet.
1. Using standard round cookie cutter cut out cookies of approximately 3 inches in diameter.
1. Place them on prepared baking sheet and repeat the process with the remaining.
1. Brush their top with milk at room temperature.
1. Place them in the refrigerator while we preheat the oven at 200 degree celcius.
1. Bake them for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown.
