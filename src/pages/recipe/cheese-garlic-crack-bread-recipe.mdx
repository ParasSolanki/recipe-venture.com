### Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons Veeba Pasta sauce.
- 1 tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- 2 teaspoons Mixed Herbs (Dried).
- 3 Burger buns - mini.
- 2 tablespoons Garlic - finely chopped.
- 1/2 cup Mozzarella cheese.
- 1 tablespoon Coriander (Dhania) Leaves.
- 3 tablespoons Salted butter.

### Instructions

1. To start making the Cheese Garlic Cracked Bread Recipe, preheat the oven to 200 degree celsius.
1. We need to now cut the burger buns to give a cracked effect.
1. To do that, we need to use a serrated bread knife, make 1 inch diagonal cuts across the burger buns making sure you donâ€™t cut the bread all the way through.
1. First cut straight standing lines and the cut straight sleeping lines almost until the end, making sure to don't cut it fully.
1. In a tadka pan , heat the butter and olive on medium heat, add the chopped garlic and fry until it gets a light golden colour.
1. Once it gets the desired colour, turn off the flame, add the mixed herbs and the fresh coriander leaves.
1.  Allow it to cool.
1. Next use a spoon to drizzle the garlic butter into the the cuts of the buns, and lightly spread a little veeba pasta pizza sauce in the cuts.
1. Finally, stuff grated cheese in the cuts and arrange on a baking tray.
1. Bake these buns in a preheated oven at 200 degree celsius for 7-10 minutes, till the bread gets crispy and a light brown colour on the top.
1. Remove from the oven , brush the top with the leftover garlic butter and serve hot.
