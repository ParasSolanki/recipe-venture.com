### Instructions

1. To begin making the Avarekalu Tikki Recipe Recipe, first prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. Boil the potatoes in the pressure cooker, peel and keep them aside.
1. In the same pressure cooker add the avarekalu with some water and salt and boil it for 3 whistles.
1. Leave it aside to release the pressure naturally.
1. In a bowl, add in both the boiled regular potatoes and sweet potatoes, cooked avarekalu beans, a teaspoon of grated ginger, two roughly chopped green chilies, a large finely chopped onion, spice powder, chopped mint leaves, coriander leaves and some salt to taste.
1. Use your hand to mash them until the potatoes are coarsely mashed and all the ingredients come together.
1. Once it is mixed well, shape them into kebabs or tikkis.
1. Grease your fingers with a little oil and shape the potato dough into bite size tikkis or large lemon size balls.
1. Proceed the similar way with the remaining mixture.
1. You can also shape the dough in the form of a cylinder like the kebabs, dust them in breadcrumbs and insert them into a skewer and grill them.
1. I will now place the tikkis over a heated flat pan for about 15 minutes on either side until lightly browned.
1. Drizzle some oil on each of the tikkis.
1. If you want it to be crisper then you can drizzle some more oil on top of the aloo tikkis .
1. The oil will give them a soft and yet crisp texture.
1. Serve the Avarekalu Tikki Recipe along with Masala Chai and Mavinakayi Chitranna Recipe for your evening snack.
