1. To begin making Crispy Fried Kurkuri Bhindi Recipe Spiced With Cumin & Chaat Masala, firstly wash bhindi thoroughly, dry them as much as possible with the help of a kitchen towel and trim the edges.
1. Slice vertically into thin strips.
1. If they are long, cut into two horizontally and then slit into long strips.
1. Place strips of bhindi into a large mixing bowl.
1. Now, sprinkle all the spices, besan and of rice flour over the vegetable.

1. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or deep saucepan.
1. Add the coated bhindi in batches, on a medium heat.
1. Try to separate the clumps of bhindi as much as possible.
1. Deep fry until crisp and golden brown on medium high heat; once the okra is cooked, you will notice that the oil bubbles will start to subside in the pan.
1. That's when you remove them with the help of a slotted spoon and place on absorbent paper/kitchen towel to soak the excess oil.
1. Deep fry curry leaves for a few seconds until crisp, in the same oil before switching off heat.
