### Instructions

1. Once ground into a batter.
1. Add a little salt and sugar to taste and allow the appam rice batter to ferment for about 6 hours in a warm place.
1. The fenugreek in the batter, will help in light fermentation of the batter.
1. After 6 hours, the appam batter is now ready to be used.
1. When you are ready to make the appams, stir in the baking soda and allow it to rest in the batter for about 5 minutes.
1. Preheat the Appachetty or the Appam pan on medium high heat.
1. Pour a ladle of batter on the Appachetty and swirl the pan in circular fashion to spread the batter.
1. The batter will be thick in the center and thin on the sides.
1. Cover the pan with a lid for approximately 2 minutes until it is crisped and golden brown on the sides and the centre is steamed and cooked.
1. Serve the Kerala Style Appam along with Kadala Curry or Kerala Style Vegetable Stew for breakfast or a wholesome weeknight dinner.
