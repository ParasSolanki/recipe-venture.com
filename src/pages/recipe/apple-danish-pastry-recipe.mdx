### Instructions

1. To begin making Apple Danish Pastry Recipe, preheat your oven at 200 C.
1. Prepare a baking tray and line it with a parchment paper.
1. Flatten your puff pastry sheet using a rolling pin and give it a rectangular shape.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Melt the butter in a saucepan on low heat.
1. Add the diagonally chopped apple slices and cook it for few minutes.
1. Next, add cinnamon powder and castor sugar into the saucepan.
1. Give it a good stir so that apple slices are properly coated.
1. Let it cook for a few more seconds and then turn off the heat.
1. Now start arranging the apple slices into the middle of the pastry sheet.
1. Next step involves making cuts in the sides of the pastry sheet for braiding.
1. Use a knife or kitchen scissors to make cuts on both sides of the pastry sheet.
1. Carefully braid the pastry by pulling in one slit of pastry sheet after another on the other side.
1. Once done, transfer this pastry on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
1. Now whisk egg + 1 teaspoon of water in a small bowl and apply it on the top of pastry using a silicon brush.
1. Sprinkle granulated sugar on the top for a nice texture after baking.
1. Transfer the baking tray in the oven and bake it for 15-20 minutes or till the time the pastry turns golden in colour.
1. Once the pastry is ready, take it out of the oven and let it cool down.
1. Meanwhile, mix powdered sugar and milk in small bowl and make a paste of it.
1. Once the pastry has cooled down, use a spoon for pouring the sugar-milk paste on top of the pastry.
1. Let it sit for about 10 minutes and it is ready to serve.
1. Serve Apple Danish Pastry Recipe as a party dessert after a meal of Schezwan Chicken Sizzler Recipe or Italian Pasta Sizzler Recipe or alongside Cinnamon Spiced Orange Iced Tea Recipe during evening.
