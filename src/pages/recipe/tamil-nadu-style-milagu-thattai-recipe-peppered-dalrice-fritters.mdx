### Ingredients

- 7-8 Curry leaves - pat dried and finely chopped.
- 1 teaspoon Butter (unsalted).
- Salt - to taste.
- 7-8 Whole Black Peppercorns - freshly powdered.
- 1/2 teaspoon Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- 1 tablespoon Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal) - soaked for 20 minutes.
- pinch Asafoetida (hing).
- 1 cup Rice flour - sieved.
- 1 tablespoon Urad Dal Flour.
- Sunflower Oil.

### Instructions

1. To prepare Tamil Nadu Style Milagu Thattai Recipe (Peppered dal-rice fritters), in a medium size bowl, add the sieved rice and the urad dal flour.
1. Add salt, asafoetida, sesame seeds, pepper powder, chana dal, curry leaves and mix all the dry ingredients.
1. Now add butter and rub it into the flour.
1. Add hot oil and add water little by little to form a smooth, crack free dough.
1. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes.
1. After the resting time, take small portions of the dough in greased hands, roll it into a smooth crack free ball.
1. While shaping the thattai, keep the remaining dough covered with moist cloth to prevent the dough from drying.
1. Place the dough ball on a dry kitchen towel or butter paper and flatten it into thin roundels.
1. Heat oil in a wok/kadai.
1. Test the heat of oil by dropping a small portion of dough, if its rises to top immediately, that indicates the oil is hot.
1. Fry the milagu thattai over low/medium flame till the sizzling sound stops and the thattai is uniformly browned.
1. Overheated oil does not help in even cooking, hence cook on medium flame.
1. Repeat this process for the entire batch.
1. Once cooled, store them in a clean, odour free air tight container.
1. Serve Tamil Nadu Style Milagu Thattai Recipe (Peppered dal-rice fritters) with filter coffee on a rainy day.
