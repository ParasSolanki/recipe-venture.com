1. To make the bari, mix the besan, red chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin seeds, ajwain seeds,turmeric powder, eno and salt in a mixing bowl.
1. Add enough water to make a thick batter.
1. Whisk this mixture vigorously for few minutes to make the mixture light.
1. Heat a paniyaram pan on medium heat, brush each cavity with oil, pour a spoon full of the prepared bari batter into each cavity.
1. Pour a few drops of oil around and let it cook for 3 minutes.
1. Flip over and cook the other side of the bari's, once cooked take it out in a bowl and finish making bari's with the leftover batter.
1. The baris should be golden brown in colour on the outside.

1. Heat oil a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Add bay leaf, coriander seeds and let it splutter.

1. Let the kadhi simmer for 5 minutes, until the raw smell of the besan goes away.
1. Ensure you keep whisking the khadi so it becomes smooth and does not look curdled.
1. Season the Kadhi with salt, add the prepared baris and simmer for another 10 minutes.
