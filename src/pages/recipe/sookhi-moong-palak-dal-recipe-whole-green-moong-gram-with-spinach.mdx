### Instructions

1. To begin making the Sookhi Moong Palak Dal Recipe, first drain the water from the soaked green moong and keep it aside.
1. In a mixer-grinder, add the spinach and tomatoes and puree them together.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Heat the mustard oil in an iron kadhai and add the jeera seeds to it.
1. When they start sputtering, add the onions and fry until they are soft and lightly browned.
1. Add the garlic, ginger and green chillies and saute for a few seconds until you can smell the aromas coming through.
1. Next, add the spinach-tomato puree along with salt and cook for 2 minutes.
1. To this, add the drained dal and cook on high heat, stirring often, for 5 minutes.
1. Reduce the flame to low, cover and cook undisturbed for 20 minutes.
1. Remove the lid and check the to see if the dal is cooked.
1. It should be soft and cooked but still hold its form and have some bite to it.
1. At this stage, you can take the lid off completely and cook on low heat until all the liquid has been absorbed/evaporated and the spinach coats the dal, which will take approximately 15 minutes.
1. Ensure that you stir often at this stage to avoid the sabji from sticking and burning.
1. Remove from heat and serve the Sookhi Moong Palak Dal garnished with sliced onions, green chillies and coriander along with Raita for a wholesome weeknight dinner.
