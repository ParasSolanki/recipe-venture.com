### Instructions

1. To begin making Traditional Maharashtrian Bhakarwadi Recipe, take all the ingredients required to make the dough in a mixing bowl and give it a nice mix.
1. To the dry ingredients, add water little by little, and by mixing with fingers first.
1. Once the crumbly dough is formed, knead it by applying pressure into a tight dough.
1. Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel and leave it untouched for 15-20 minutes.
1. This will help in increasing the binding strength of the flour.
1. Meanwhile, take all the ingredients required for filling and blend it into a coarse masala powder in a food processor, except the tamarind powder (or tomato ketchup).
1. After resting time, divide the dough into equal sized balls.
1. Roll each ball into a thick roti.
1. Brush the roti with tomato ketchup/tamarind paste and spread the filling of masala powder all over the roti.
1. Roll tightly to form a roll.
1. And run a sharp knife to cut it into roundels of about 1 cm thick each.
1. Once done, heat enough oil in a deep frying pan to cook the bhakarwadi.
1. Once the oil is hot, on a medium heat, drop the prepared bhakarwadi in batches and deep fry them till done and brownish in colour.
1. Take them out once done and absorb excess oil by putting them on a kitchen towel.
1. Once all the bhakarwadi are done and cooled, store them in an airtight container till required.
1. These bhakarwadi stay good for a couple of weeks.
1. Serve Traditional Maharashtrian Bhakarwadi Recipe over tea time with Masala Chai Recipe and Gajar Ka Halwa Recipe or Chole Aloo Tikki Chaat Recipe.
