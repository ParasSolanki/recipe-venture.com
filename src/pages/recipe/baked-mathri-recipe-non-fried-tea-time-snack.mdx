### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon Whole Black Peppercorns - coarsely crushed.
- 1-1/2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/2 teaspoon Ajwain (Carom seeds) - or cumin seeds.
- 1/4 cup Chilled butter - finely chopped.
- 2 tablespoons Chilled water - (adjust).
- 1 teaspoon Salt.

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180 C.
1. To begin making the Baked Mathri recipe, combine the flour, salt, black pepper and kalonji.
1. Work the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
1. Sprinkle ice water onto the crumbly dough and with your hands push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together and becomes a firm dough, yet pliable dough.
1. Cover the mathri dough with the damp cloth and set aside for 15 minutes.
1. Divide the mathri dough into small balls and roll out all the balls into small circles of 2 inch diameter and about 1/2 inch thickness.
1. You can also optionally, roll the dough into a large circle, and use a cookie cutter to cut them into circles.
1. Arrange the mathri dough circles on a greased baking sheet and prick them evenly with a fork, to prevent them from puffing while in the oven.
1. Bake the mathri's for about 20 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.
1. Remove the mathri's out of the oven and allow them to cool completely before serving.
1. Once cooled completely, store the Baked Mathri's in an airtight container.
1. Savor these delicious Baked Mathriâ€™s with a spicy mango Punjabi pickle as a tea time snack.
