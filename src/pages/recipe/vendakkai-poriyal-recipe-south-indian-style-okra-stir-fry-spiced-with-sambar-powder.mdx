### Ingredients

- 1 sprig Curry leaves - roughly torn.
- Red Chilli powder - according to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- Salt - according to taste.
- 1/2 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 1 teaspoon Sambar Powder.
- 500 grams Bhindi (Lady Finger/Okra) - cut into rounds.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vendakkai Poriyal Recipe, we will be using a Wok or Kadai style pan to cook the okra.
1. Heat a tablespoon of oil in the wok; add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Once the mustard seed crackle, add the curry leaves and the cut Vendakkai (Okra).
1. Sprinkle some salt and cover the pan.
1. Keep the heat on medium and cook the Vendakkai (Okra), until you see its getting moist and softened (partially cooked).
1. This will take about 4 to 5 minutes.
1. As soon as you notice moisture on the Vendakkai (Okra) and it is partially cooked, place a large ladle in the wok and cover the wok again.
1. With the ladle in place and the lid slightly ajar, we are allowing the steam to escape from the wok at the same time allow the Vendakkai (Okra) to get cooked through.
1. The reason we are keeping the lid slightly ajar, is so that we are letting some moisture escape and prevent the Vendakkai (Okra) to get mushy and gooey.
1. Once you notice the Vendakkai (Okra) is cooked through and is soft, add the sambar powder, asafoetida and give it a stir.
1. Stir-fry for another 3 to 4 minutes keeping the wok open so the spices get well blended into the Vendakkai (Okra) Poriyal.
1. Once done, check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
