### Instructions

1. To begin making the Carrot Poriyal Recipe, we will first steam the carrots, until soft and tender.
1. You can use a steamer to steam the carrots, but here I will show you how to cook using a pressure cooker.
1. Place the cut carrot into the pressure cooker, sprinkle some salt and add 3 tablespoons of water.
1. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and pressure cook until you hear 2 whistles.
1. After 2 whistles turn off the heat.
1. Place the pressure cooker under running water to release the pressure immediately.
1. By releasing the pressure immediately, we prevent the carrots from getting over cooked.
1. Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and keep the carrots aside.
1. Our next step is to season the carrots:Heat a teaspoon of oil in a wok; add mustard seeds, urad dal, curry leaves, and red chilli.
1. Stir fry until the urad dal is lightly roasted and browned.
1. Once they crackle and brown; add asafoetida, turmeric powder, carrot and salt.
1. Saut√© for few minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Check the salt and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Transfer the carrots to a serving bowl.
1. Serve Carrot Poriyal along with Tomato Rasam, Keerai Sambar, Steamed Rice and Elai Vadam for a weekday meal.
