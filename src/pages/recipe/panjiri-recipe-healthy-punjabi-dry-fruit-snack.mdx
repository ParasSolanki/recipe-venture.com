### Instructions

1. To begin making the Punjabi Panjiri Recipe, make sure all your ingredients are measured out and arranged neatly on the counter.
1. Heat a kadai with a tablespoon of ghee on medium-low flame, and make sure the ghee is well heated.
1. To this add the gondh crystals and stir them occasionally, until they puff up well.
1. Once they have puffed up, turn off the flame and remove the puffed gondh in a plate and set aside.
1. Next add a tablespoon ghee yet again on medium low flame and roast the makhana until well roasted.
1. This will take about 2-3 minutes.
1. Likewise use a tablespoon of ghee each and roast the almonds, cashew, pistachios, dry coconut slices, melon seeds, flax seeds, and the poppy seeds.
1. Once each of these are roasted individually, and set them aside to cool.
1. Combine the puffed gondh, roasted makhana, almonds, cashew, pistachios, dry coconut slices, melon seeds, flax seeds, and the poppy seeds in a mixing bowl and transfer to a mixer jar and grind to a coarse mixture.
1. Transfer the freshly ground coarse mixture, into a large mixing bowl.
1. Heat the remaining ghee in the kadai on medium-low flame, add the rawa and the whole wheat flour and roast until the mixture turns into a light brown colour.
1. To this add the dry ginger powder, nutmeg and cardamom powder, mix well and allow it to cool.
1. Once cooled add in the sugar powder and adjust the sweetness according to your taste.
1. Transfer this sweetened rawa-wheat flour mixture into the mixing bowl that contains the freshly ground dry fruit coarse mixture.
1. Mix well until combined and store in an airtight container for 2-3 weeks.
1. Serve Panjiri Recipe along with a Turmeric Milk Recipe - Haldi Doodh / Golden Milk or Badam Milk Recipe - Almond Milk as a snack during the winter season.
