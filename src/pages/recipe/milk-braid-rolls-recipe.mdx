### Instructions

1. To begin making Milk Braid Rolls Recipe, add all the ingredients to the bowl of stand mixer with dough hook attached.
1. Mix all the ingredients on low speed for 2 minutes.
1. Later increase the speed and continue mixing for another ten minutes.
1. In case you do not have a stand mixer, take all the ingredients into a bowl and knead them to a dough.
1. The dough would be sticky.
1. Later invert the sticky dough on to flat surface and continue kneading for another 15 to 20 minutes until the dough turns out pliable.
1. Do not add any dry flour while kneading once it is off the stand mixer.
1. This is time consuming and tricky, but helps in developing the gluten that makes the rolls softer and spongy.
1. Do the windowpane test and check for its elasticity and doneness.
1. Windowpane test is done by pulling out a large lemon sized dough and stretching it between the fingers such that the dough is thin, pliable and ready for proofing without getting teared.
1. Once the dough is ready, place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl, cover with cling film and set in a warm place until doubled.
1. This might take a couple of hours or more, depending on the temperature of the area.
1. Later knock out the air from the dough knead it for a couple of seconds.
1. Weigh your dough and divide into 24 equal portions.
1. Roll out each dough portion into logs of 8 to 10 inches long.
1. Take three logs at a time and plait them to a braid, by interlocking one after the other log of dough.
1. Repeat the process till done and this recipe plaits 8 braids out of 24 dough portions.
1. You need to divide the dough into logs i multiples of 3.
1. Place the braids over baking tray lined with parchment paper.
1. Brush them with milk or beaten egg, sprinkle with seeds of choice like sesame, poppy and flax seeds.
1. Cover the tray and set it in a warm place until doubled in size.
1. Bake them in a preheated oven at 200 degree celcius for 15 minutes or till done.
1. Once golden baked, remove and brush the hot rolls with melted butter and cool them to room temperature on a wire rack.
1. Store the braid rolls in an airtight container or pack in a zip lock and cherish for upto 4 to 5 days.
