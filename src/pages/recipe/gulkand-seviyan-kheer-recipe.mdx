### Ingredients

- 6 Pistachios - chopped.
- Saffron strands - a few.
- 1-1/2 liter Milk - full fat.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 70 grams Thin Semiya (Seviyan).
- Rose water - as required.
- 1/3 cup Gulkand.
- Dried rose petals - for garnish.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Gulkand Seviyan Kheer Recipe in a saucepan bring the milk to a rolling boil.
1. Once the milk has boiled, reduce the flame, and allow the milk to simmer on low flame, until it reduces to half its quantity.
1. This process will take a good 20 minutes.
1. Ensure the milk is stirred occasionally to prevent the bottom of the pan burning the milk.
1. It is also always a good idea to keep a ladle inside the milk container.
1. Once the milk is reduced, add the cardamom powder, and a few strands of saffron.
1. Next, to this add the gulkand and mix vigorously until it melts and comes together along with the milk.
1. Adjust the sweetness of the gulkand kheer, based on the sweetness of the gulkand, if required add sugar to suit your taste.
1. Since the gulkand is already packed with the rose flavour, depending on how strong or mild you prefer, add the rose water, according to how aromatic you like the gulkand kheer to be.
1. Finally, add in the thin seviyan and wait until the seviyan wilts down and becomes soft.
1. Turn off the heat, transfer the Gulkand kheer to a serving bowl and garnish with some crushed pistachios and dry rose petals.
1. Serve Gulkand Seviyan Kheer as dessert or part of a meal that consists of Ajwain Puri Recipe, and Aloo Tamatari Recipe for a lovely comforting Sunday brunch.
