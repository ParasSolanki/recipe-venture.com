### Ingredients

- 3/4 cup Sugar.
- 5 tablespoon Sugar - for dusting.
- 6 tablespoon Ghee.
- 2 liter Milk.
- 2 cups Milk.
- 2 tablespoon Lemon juice - or curd.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Dharwad Peda Recipe, heat milk in a saucepan on a medium heat.
1. Once it comes to a boil add the lemon juice and mix till the milk curdles.
1. You will have to separate the curdled cheese from the whey, so drain it over a muslin cloth or a strainer and squeeze out all the water.
1. Transfer the squeezed cheese onto a kadai with 3 tablespoons ghee over a medium heat, by using a spatula start breaking the cheese and create a crumbly texture.
1. Once that is done, add the sugar and 1 cup milk and combine till the sugar dissolves.
1. Switch off the heat and allow it to cool down.
1. Blitz it in a grinder to a smooth creamy paste.
1. Add this paste on to a kadai and keep it over a medium heat.
1. Keep stirring till the water evaporates and you are left with a thick batter without any lumps.
1. Keep stirring and after sometime it will become grainy again, add the left over ghee and keep mixing till the mixture turns medium brown.
1. If you feel that the mixture is too grainy, keep adding milk little by little and combine.
1. Do until the mixture turns brown, cool it down and blitz it with little reserved milk (2 tablespoon milk) to a smooth mixture.
1. Take a small amount of the peda and shape them into desired shapes and coat it with powdered sugar.
1. Do the same for the rest.
1. Serve the Dharwad Peda Recipe as a festive dessert along with other desserts like Churma Laddu With Coconut to enjoy it with your family and children.
