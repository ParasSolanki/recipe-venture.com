1. Mix well.
1. Take a big mixing bowl and add butter, condensed milk, sugar, yogurt, vanilla essence and mix it well until it forms a creamy texture.
1. Now sprinkle some plain flour over the tutti frutti and spread it well (Dusting the tutti frutti with some flour before incorporating them into the batter helps in even distribution preventing them from sinking to the bottom of the cake).
1. Now add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture.
1. Mix very well.
1. For the right consistency, add milk if needed.
1. Add tutti frutti and raisins and at last add white vinegar and then mix it well.

1. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes at the same temperature.
1. The top needs to turn golden brown and a tester (toothpick) should come out clean.
1. Allow the Eggless Tutti Frutti Cake to cool for 1 hour.
1. Then slice and enjoy with Masala Chai or Filter Coffee.
