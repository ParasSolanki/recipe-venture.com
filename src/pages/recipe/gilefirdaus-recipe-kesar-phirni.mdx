### Ingredients

- Few Saffron strands.
- 10 Raisins.
- 1 Edible Silver Foil/Leaf (Chandi Ka Vark) - optional.
- 1 liter Milk - full cream milk.
- 1 cup Sugar.
- 1 tablespoon Pistachios - chopped.
- 1 cup Rice - coarsely grounded.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1 teaspoon Dried rose petals.
- 10 Cashew nuts - chopped.
- 1 teaspoon Mixed nuts - chopped (I used almonds and pistachios).
- 10 Badam (Almond) - sliced.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Gil-E-Firdaus recipe, for making ground rice, wash and drain and let the rice rest for around 30 minutes.
1. In a grinder add rice and grind it coarsely and keep aside.
1. Heat milk in a thick bottomed vessel.
1. As soon as the milk comes to a boil, add saffron and grounded rice and stir well.
1. Break lumps if any.
1. Keep stirring in medium to low heat to avoid getting burnt.
1. Add cardamom powder and chopped dry fruits except raisins.
1. We shall add raisins at the end to avoid milk getting separate.
1. Keep stirring till the rice gets cooked and milk becomes thick and creamy.
1. Scratch the sides of the vessel with a spatula to remove the thick cream accumulated.
1. Drop that cream in the milk, that will make it more rick and creamy.
1. Now add sugar to and stir well.
1. You may suddenly find the milk getting a thin, but that's okay as sugar has a tendency to leave water.
1. Cook the phirni for another few minutes till you get the required consistency.
1. Turn off the flames and allow it to cool at room temperature.
1. Transfer it to the serving bowls, cups or glasses and refrigerate it till chilled.
1. Garnish each serving with chopped almonds, pistachios, saffron and dried rose petals and serve chilled.
1. Serve Gil-E-Firdaus on festivals or as a dessert after your festive Diwali meal.
