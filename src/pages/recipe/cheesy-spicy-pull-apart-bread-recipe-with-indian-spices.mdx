1. Cover the bread dough and keep it aside in a warm place to rise until doubled for about 2 hours.
1. Cook the soy nuggets in hot boiling water until it feels soft and spongy.
1. Once cooked, drain the water out and squeeze the excess water.
1. Mince the soy nuggets and keep aside.
1. While the dough is rising we will prepare the spicy masala for the filling.
1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan over medium heat.

1. After couple of hours, once the dough has risen, punch down the dough and roll it into a large disc on a floured surface.
1.  With a cookie cutter, cut medium sized round discs and spoon enough masala in the center.
1. Fold the disc filled with masala into a half moon and tuck the edges together.
1. I will look like a calzone or a gujiya.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining dough portions.
1. Arrange the half moon filled dough in a round springform baking pan.
1. Allow the dough to rest for an hour in a warm place.
1. This will help the dough to rise the second time.
