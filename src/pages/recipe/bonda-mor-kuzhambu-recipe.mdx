1. Take out this batter in a bowl, season with salt and whisk it vigorously to attain a light texture.
1. In the mean also soak the coriander seeds, toor dal and a died red chilli in water and keep aside.
1. Heat enough oil in a frying pan on medium heat, and once the oil is hot enough, drop a spoon full of small balls of the bond batter into the oil and fry till golden brown as you would make the medu vada's.
1. Remove, drain it on the kitchen absorbent paper and keep it aside.
1. Likewise, prepare the bonda's with the remaining batter.
1. Now, to make the mor kuzhambu take the soaked coriander seeds, toor dal and red chilli in a mixie jar and grind it to a smooth paste along with ginger and grated coconut.
1. Take a bowl, whisk the curd to smooth texture, add the ground coconut mix to it, season with salt and whisk it together.
1. Heat oil in a pan on medium heat, add mustard seeds, chana dal and let it crackle.
1. Add the asafoetida, a dried red chilli and curry leaves and let it splutter.
1. Add the sour curd and coconut mix to this, 2 to 3 cups of water and bring it to a boil.
1. If the mor kuzhambu is too thick, add more water, adjust the seasoning and simmer for around 10 minutes.
1. Once the Mor Kuzhambu is well cooked, add the prepared bonda's to it, bring it to a gentle boil and switch off the flame.
1. Serve the Bonda Mor Kuzhambu Recipe along with Steamed Rice and Crispy Potato Fry for a delicious weeknight dinner or for the weekend brunch.
