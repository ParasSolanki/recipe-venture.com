- 1 1/2 teaspoon Active dry yeast.
- 1/4 cup Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - finely chopped.
- 1 tablespoon Butter.
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- Butter - to smear on the naans.
- 1/2 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 cup Cheese - grated.
- 1-1/2 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Cheese Garlic Naan Recipe, we need to make the dough to ensure it is well rested.
1. To make the dough in a mixing bowl, combine the all purpose flour, along with the whole wheat flour, active dry yeast, salt, garlic, coriander leaves, butter and mix well until the ingredients are well combined.
1. Now knead the dough with the curd and use the required amount of water to knead a soft dough.
1. Finally add in a teaspoon of oil and knead into a smooth dough and shape it into a large dough ball.
1. Place this in a greased bowl, and cover with a damp cloth and keep it rested in a warm place for about two hours.
1. Once the naan dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough, knead for a minute and divide into equal portions.
1. Heat a cast iron tawa on medium heat, and keep it ready.
1. Roll out each dough ball into a 4 inch diameter, place the grated cheese, and bring the edges together and make a potli, flatten between your palms, dust it in flour and begin to roll in a way that we get elongated, oval naans.
1. Brush water on one side of the naan, and evenly spread it on the entire surface of the naan, now place this naan on the tawa, with the water side face down, quickly sprinkle some chopped garlic, and press it down on the naan, in a way it gets embedded in the Cheese Garlic Naan.
1. Next, after about 40 seconds, flip the tawa upside down, in a way that the tawa is up and the naan is in direct contact with the flame.
1. Gradually the naan , will fall off from the tawa, using a pair of tongs, take the Cheese Garlic Naan from the griddle and cook the other side directly on the flame.
1. Keep moving the naan for even cooking.
1. Remove from the flame, slather some butter and serve hot.
