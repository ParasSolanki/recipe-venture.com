### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 3 Potatoes (Aloo) - cut into 1 inch wedges.
- 300 grams Bhindi (Lady Finger/Okra) - cut into 1 inch pieces.
- 1 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 1 teaspoons Poppy seeds.
- Mustard oil - for cooking.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Aloo Bhindi Recipe first prep all the vegetables and keep aside.
1. Make a powder of the mustard and poppy seeds and keep aside.
1. We will roast the aloo and bhindi separately and then finally mix it all together.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a Heavy Bottomed Pan, add the potatoes, sprinkle some salt and stir fry on medium heat until the potatoes are half way cooked.
1. Keep the pan covered in the cooking process so the steam helps it cook faster.
1. Once the potatoes/ aloo are half way cooked, stir in the turmeric powder and chili powder and saute for a few minutes.
1. Cook the potatoes until completely done.
1. Once done, transfer to a bowl and keep aside.
1. In the same pan, heat another teaspoon of oil.
1. Add the bhini, sprinkle salt and cook until soft and tender.
1. Cover and keep the lid of the pan slightly ajar.
1. Keeping the lid slightly ajar helps the steam circulate in the pan, plus prevents the bhindi from getting sticky.
1. Once the bhindi is cooked, add the poppy and mustard seed powder, the roasted potatoes and any more salt to taste.
1. Stir fry the Aloo Bhindi sabzi for another 4 to 5 minutes until all the flavors are incorporated.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and keep aside.
1. Serve the Aloo Bhindi Recipe along with Cholar Dal Recipe (Bengali Style Chana Dal) and Bengali Luchi Recipe  for a cozy sunday lunch.
