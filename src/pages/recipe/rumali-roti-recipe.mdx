### Ingredients

- 1 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- Salt - to taste.
- Lukewarm Water - to knead.
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1/4 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rumali Roti Recipe, mix all the ingredients together and knead it into a soft dough.
1. Rest the dough for around 10 minutes.
1. Then knead one last time and pinch out a small portion from the dough.
1. Toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter.
1. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.
1. Roll it as thin as possible.
1. Tip: It is a good idea to roll out a batch of dough so it gets easier to cook the entire batch.
1. Although Gujarati ladies are very quick in rolling and cooking them simultaneously; this comes with practice of rolling and understanding the heat of your skillet.
1. Heat a dosa tawa so that you can cook the big roti well.
1. Place rolled dough on the hot skillet.
1. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form.
1. At this point flip the rolled dough to cook the other side on the skillet.
1. Serve the Rumali Roti Recipe, along with Butter chicken or Paneer Kadai to enjoy your lunch.
