1. To make the paratha take the required portion of Aloo Bathua Paratha dough and dust with dry wheat flour and flatten to a three inch diameter.
1. Take the Aloo Bathua stuffing which should be larger than the size of the dough you took and place in the center.
1. Fold the edges and bring the dough towards the center to close the ball.
1. Remove any excess dough at the top.
1. Place the Aloo Bathua Paratha on a flat surface dusted with wheat flour and roll gently.
1. Once you have reached the desired size and thickness place the Aloo Bathua Paratha on the preheated tava and cook until the Aloo Bathua Paratha turns golden on both sides.
1. Smear ghee and cook the Aloo Bathua Paratha until it is cooked through and is golden brown and crisp.
