### Instructions

1. To begin making Bengali Chirer Pulao Recipe, we will first steam the green peas, carrots, cauliflower and beans in a steamer until it is cooked.
1. Once cooked, remove from the steamer and keep the vegetables aside.
1. Place the poha (Chirer) in a colander and rinse it well under running water.
1. Stir the poha gently by using your fingers while rinsing, otherwise they will become mushy at the time of cooking.
1. Once washed set aside the poha.
1. The next step is to bring the Chirer Pulao together.
1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan or a wok.
1. Add the nigella seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Add sliced onions and saute over medium heat till light brown in color.
1.  Once the onions are tender, add the turmeric powder, steamed vegetables, peanuts, raisins, salt and sugar.
1. Stir to combine and finally add rinsed poha (Chirer).
1. Give the Bengali Chirer Pulao a gentle stir until all the ingredients come together.
1. Turn the heat to low and cover the pan.
1. Allow the Bengali Chirer Pulao to cook in the steam along with the vegetables.
1. This will take about 3 to 4 minutes.
1. After 3 to 4 minutes, you will notice the Chirer Pulao has puffed up slightly.
1. At this stage turn off the heat.
1. Stir in the juice from one lemon and the coriander leaves.
1. Check the salt and seasonings and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Serve the Bengali Chirer Pulao for the breakfast along with a hot cup of Masala Chai or enjoy it as an evening tea time snack.
