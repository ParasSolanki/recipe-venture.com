- 4 Ripe Bananas - robusta variety.
- 2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract.
- 2 teaspoons Baking powder.
- 1/4 cup Milk.
- 1/4 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Eggless Banana Pressure Cooker Cake Recipe, first prep all the ingredients and keep them aside.
1. Grease the pressure cooker rice container with oil and dust it in flour.
1. Keep aside.
1. In a mixing bowl, add the over ripe bananas and mash them using the potato masher.
1. Once mashed, add the sugar, oil, vanilla extract, milk and curd.
1. Stir well to combine all the wet ingredient.
1. Into the same bowl, add the cinnamon powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
1. Mix well and beat until fluffly.
1. Finallly add the maida (all purpose flour) and beat well to combine the Eggless Banana Cake batter.
1. Once done, pour the Eggless Banana Cake batter into the greased cake pan.
1. Place the trivet at the bottom of the Pressure Cooker.
1. Fill the pressure cooker with water until it has at least 2 inch of water.
1. You want to make sure that the water does not seep into the cake batter while it is getting cooked in the pressure cooker.
1. The watermark should be only little less than half way through the rice pan.
1. Cover the pressure cooker without the weight and bake the Eggless Banana Pressure Cooker Cake Recipe for 40 minutes on high heat.
1. After 40 minutes, when you insert a knife, you will get a clean cake - there might be a few crumbs stuck, which is ok.
1. If the crumbs are cooked and not raw, then the Eggless Banana Pressure Cooker Cake is ready.
1. Remove the Eggless Banana Pressure Cooker Cake Recipe from the pressure cooker immediately and allow it to cook completely, before you can cut.
1. Serve the Eggless Banana Pressure Cooker Cake Recipe along with a cup of Kesar Chai as a tea time snack or even serve it as a snack for kids.
