### Ingredients

- 1 inch Ginger - chopped.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/4 teaspoon SSP Asafoetida (Hing).
- 1/2 teaspoon Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- 1/4 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 1 Green Chillies.
- 1/2 cup Rice - (raw rice).
- 1/2 cup White Urad Dal (Whole).
- 1 teaspoon Curry leaves - finely chopped.
- 1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil.
- 2 cups Sweet corn.
- 1/2 cup Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Tawa Handvo With Corn recipe we first need to wash and soak the rice and dal together for at least 4 to 5 hours.
1. Grind the rice, dal, green chillies, ginger along with the soaked water to make a thick batter that is slightly coarse.
1. The coarseness should feel like fine semolina.
1. The consistency of the batter should be such that when you use a ladle to pour it should fall in dollops.
1. Stir in the salt and allow the mixture to ferment for 8 hours.
1. Once fermented you will notice the handvo  batter has risen.
1.  Gently stir in a tablespoon of oil to the batter.
1. If your batter for some reason did not rise; stir 2 teaspoons of eno fruit salt into the batter and you will notice the air bubbles start popping out from the batter.
1. Heat one tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet (8 inches diameter) on medium high heat; add the sesame seeds curry leaves; allow them to crackle.
1. Turn the heat to low and sprinkle the red chilli powder and asafoetida into the oil.
1. Sprinkle and spread some sweet corn evenly around the bottom of the pan.
1. Pour two ladles of batter into the pan and gently spread the batter evenly onto the pan.
1. As you spread the batter the seasoning mixture will spread to the side; allow the seasoning to rest in place where it has spread as this gives a special crunchiness to the sides of the Tawa Handvo.
1. Turn the heat low, drizzle a teaspoon of oil around the batter and cover the pan.
1. Simmer for 3-4 minutes until the top feels cooked and steamed.
1. Once you notice the top is cooked and there is no trace of raw batter, gently flip the Tawa Handvo with the help of a broad flat spatula to the opposite side and turn the heat to medium high.
1. Allow the Tawa Handvo to turn golden brown and crisp.
1. Flip over once again and allow the other side to brown and crisp slightly.
1. Continue making similar Tawa Handvo with Corn with the rest of the batter and serve hot.
1. Serve Tawa Handvo With Corn along with Gor Keri pickle or with Gor (jaggery) and homemade butter for breakfast or a weeknight dinner.
