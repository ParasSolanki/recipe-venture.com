### Ingredients

- 1 cup Fresh coconut - grated.
- 1 teaspoon Active dry yeast.
- 6 Whole Eggs.
- Salt - to taste.
- 2 cups Rice - raw.
- 2 tablespoons Sugar.
- 1 cup Cooked rice.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Sri Lankan Muttai Appam Recipe, we need to first soak the rice in water for at least 3 to 4 hours.
1. Next combine the salt, sugar and yeast in the warm water and allow it to bubble up for 5 minutes.
1. I used an instant dry yeast, a variety that does not need proofing, hence I add it directly to the Appam batter.
1. Grind the soaked rice, cooked rice and coconut, adding just a little water and salt to make a thick batter.
1. Add in the proofed yeast to the batter and stir well to combine.
1. Transfer the Appam batter to a bowl.
1. Cover the bowl and allow it to ferment for 5 to 6 hours or overnight.
1. Adjust the consistency of the fermented Appam batter, adding water a little at a time to make it of  medium pouring consistency.
1. Do not make the batter too thin or too thick.
1. Preheat the Appachetty or the Appam pan on medium high heat.
1. Pour a ladle of batter on the Appachetty and swirl the pan in circular fashion to spread the batter.
1. The batter will be thick in the center and thin on the sides.
1. Break a whole egg in the center of the pan, sprinkle some salt and pepper.
1. Cover the pan with a lid for approximately 2 minutes until the Muttai Appam is crisped and golden brown on the sides and the centre is steamed and cooked.
1. Serve Sri Lankan Muttai Appam Recipe along with Sri Lankan Chicken Curry Recipe or Sri Lankan Egg Curry Recipe, finish off with a dessert of Watalappan Recipe for a complete Sri Lankan meal.
