### Instructions

1. Dilute the paste with 1/4 cup of water and keep it ready.
1. In a saucepan, bring the milk to boil.
1. Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the flame to low and add the ground rice paste.
1. Cook stirring continuously on low or medium flame, until the milk thickens like a porridge and rice paste is fully cooked.
1. Keep on scraping the dried milk which gets collected on the sides of the pan, such that the cream of this milk-rice mixture adds a nice texture to the phirni.
1. Once the rice is cooked completely and it is in a porridge consistency, add rest of the ingredients including condensed milk, dried rose petals, gulkand, sugar, rose water, cardamom powder, fennel powder, rose water and cook for a few more minutes until everything gets blended well.
1. Switch off flame and allow the phirni to cool.
1. You can refrigerate gulkand phirni for 3-4 hours or until well chilled.
1. Serve Rose Gulkand Phirni Recipe with garnished nuts & dried rose petals for dessert.
1. Serve Rose Gulkand Phirni after a delicious meal of Aloo Gobi Ki Sabzi, Ajwain Puri and Boondi Raita on a weekend for brunch or a meal.
