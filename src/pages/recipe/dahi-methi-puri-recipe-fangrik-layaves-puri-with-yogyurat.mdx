### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 3/4 cup Methi Leaves (Fenugreek Leaves) - washed and finely chopped.
- 1/4 teaspoon Ajwain (Carom seeds).
- 1-1/2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 3/4 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).
- 1/2 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).

### Instructions

1. To begin making Dahi Methi Puri Recipe, we will first make the dough.
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour along with methi leaves, salt, cumin seeds, ajwain and mix well to combine.
1. Next bring the dough together with the curd to make a smooth and soft dough.
1. If required, use a little water, if the curd is not enough to make a soft dough.
1. Sprinkle a few drops of oil and smoothen out the dough.
1. Make equal portions of the dough, similar to the size of a lemon.
1. Dust each portion of the dough in flour and flatten using a rolling pin to a 3 inch diameter of medium thickness.
1. Preheat oil in a kadai on medium heat, gently slide the flattened Dahi Methi Puri into the kadai, and gently fry the puri with a slotted spatula, continuously yet gently pouring oil onto the puri, allowing it to puff up.
1. Flip and cook on the other side for about 30-40 seconds.
1.  Remove from the kadai and place on an absorbent paper, to drain off the excess oil.
1. Serve Dahi Methi Puris hot.
1. Serve Dahi Methi Puri along with Sukhi Aloo Sabzi Recipe or Peshawari Chole Recipe alongside some Rava Kesari Bhath and a glass of Kesar Pista Lassi Recipe for a Sunday brunch.
