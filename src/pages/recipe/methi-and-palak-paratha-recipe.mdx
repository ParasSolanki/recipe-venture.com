### Instructions

1. To begin making the Methi and Palak Paratha Recipe, in a pan heat oil over medium heat.
1. Add the cumin seeds and allow them to sputter.
1. Next add the chopped onions and grated garlic, fry until fragrant.
1. When the onions turn light brown in color, add the turmeric powder and red chilli powder.
1. Sauté for a minute or so.
1. Then add the cumin powder, coriander powder and sauté again for few seconds.
1. Add the chopped spinach and methi along with salt and chaat masala.
1. Stir to combine and cook the greens over medium flame.
1. The greens will immediately release water, so keep stirring until they are fully cooked and the water evaporates completely.
1. Turn off the heat, transfer spinach and methi leaves to a bowl and set aside to cool completely.
1. In a large bowl, add the whole wheat flour along with cooked spinach and methi mixture.
1. Gently rub the greens and flour with your fingers.
1. Using little water at a time knead it together to make a firm and smooth dough.
1. Drizzle a teaspoon oil on the top and knead until the dough is smooth but not sticky.
1. To make the parathas, divide the dough into 8-10 portions of equal size.
1. Roll each portion out into a flat paratha about 6-7 inches in diameterOur next step is to cook the paratha; for this preheat a skillet (Roti Tawa).
1. When the tawa is hot; place the rolled out paratha in the skillet and cook for a minute on both sides until you notice a few brown spots appear on both sides.
1. No Oil MethodAt this stage, you can skip smearing paratha with oil for cooking, instead cook it directly over the flame like Chapati until the paratha is fully cooked from both the sides.
1. Serve the paratha hot with Raita and ChutneyWith Oil MethodWhen you notice the brown spots, smear a teaspoon of ghee or oil on both sides and cook until the paratha has turned golden brown and lightly crisp on both sides.
1. Cook on medium and not high heat as you want the paratha to get cooked evenly.
1. Once the paratha is done, place it on a platter and proceed to cook the remaining parathas.
