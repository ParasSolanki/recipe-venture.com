1. Pour 1/2 cup of milk into a mixing bowl and evenly sprinkle some gelatin on top; set aside for two minutes.

1. Once cool, whip up the remaining 1/2 cup of cream and gently fold it into the panna cotta.
1. Now pour it over the strawberry coulis and chill for 2 hrs.
1. Make sure the strawberry is set first or the layers will run into each other.
1. If you are making this well ahead of time, cover with foil tightly, and keep in fridge overnight.

1. You just have to use chopped mangoes instead of strawberries.
