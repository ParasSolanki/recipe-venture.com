### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Ghee.
- 1 teaspoon Dry ginger powder.
- 1/2 cup Jaggery - powdered/ grated.
- 1/4 cup Badam (Almond) - fine sliced.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi) - freshly ground.
- 2 tablespoons Dessicated Coconut.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Golpapdi Recipe (Gol Papdi/ Sukhdi), melt the ghee in a frying pan and add the wheat flour and cardamom powder and ginger stirring constantly till it turns golden brown and releases the roasted aroma.
1. This process takes about 10 minutes on medium heat.
1. Ensure the heat is not on high as it will burn the wheat flour too quickly.
1. Once the wheat flour has turned a good brown color, turn off the heat and quickly add the jaggery and stir well, so the jaggery melts quickly in the heat into the wheat flour.
1. Note: The addition of jaggery to the wheat flour mixture is a tricky procedure.
1. The whole mixture can get brittle and gooey.
1. So use caution, and turn off heat just before adding jaggery.
1. As soon as the jaggery melts, and the mixture is still warm, pour the mixture into a greased baking sheet and spread it evenly with a 3/4th inch thickness.
1. Sprinkle the sliced almonds and coconut and cut into diamond/square shapes while it is still warm.
1. Set the Golpapdi / Gur Papdi / Sukhdi aside and allow it to sit untouched, you can also refrigerate it for it to set faster.
1. After about an hour, once the it has cooled, you will find that the crisp Golpapdi is ready.
1. Store the Golpapdi / Gur Papdi / Sukhdi in airtight containers for about 2 weeks in the refrigerator for maximum freshness.
1. Serve the Golpapdi Recipe / Gur Papdi / Sukhdi as a delicious Tea Time Snack or After School Snacks.
