### Ingredients

- 3 Cardamom (Elaichi) Pods/Seeds - crushed finely.
- 1 cup Broken Wheat (Dalia/ Godumai Rava).
- 3 tablespoons Coconut Oil - virgin oil.
- 10 Cashew nuts.
- 1/4 cup Fresh coconut - grated.
- 2 teaspoons Poppy seeds.
- 1-1/4 cup Jaggery.
- 10 Badam (Almond).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vegan Godhi Payasa recipe, soak almonds and cashews in water for an hour.
1. Grind almonds (peeled), cashews, poppy seeds and coconut with little water into a smooth paste in a mixer grinder.
1. Wash and soak the broken wheat in water for 1 hour.
1. Drain the broken wheat using a colander and squeeze excess water with your hands.
1. Heat coconut oil in a heavy bottomed pan on low flame, and add the broken wheat and saute it until it is fluffy and starts to turn golden.
1. Next, add the jaggery and stir it around for a couple of minutes until the broken wheat absorbs the sweetness, add the crushed cardamom.
1. Once the pan loses moisture and starts to catch the bottom, add 3 cups of water, cover and cook on medium heat until 90 percent of the water is absorbed.
1. Now, add the above prepared nut paste, mix it all together and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Add some water if required to adjust the consistency according to your preference.
1. Serve hot or chilled.
1. You can garnish with dried fruit and nuts if you wish, since we use the nut paste and the texture of the Broken wheat is quite nutty you will not miss any dry fruit garnish.
1. Serve Vegan Godhi Payasa as a dessert after your meal of Mixed Vegetable Sambar, Steamed Rice, Carrot And Beans Thoran and Elai Vadam.
