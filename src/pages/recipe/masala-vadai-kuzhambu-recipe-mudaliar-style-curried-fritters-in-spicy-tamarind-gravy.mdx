### Instructions

1. To begin making the Masala Vadai Kuzhambu, first prepare the masala vadais.
1. To do this, thoroughly wash the dal and soak in water for 2 hours.
1. After two hours, drain the dal completely, put the dal in a mixer-grinder, add chillies, ginger and grind to a coarse paste using very little water (no more than 3 to 4 tablespoons) so that it is thick and crumbly, not runny.
1. Add chopped onions, curryleaves, salt and mix well in a bowl.
1. Place a kadai on the heat along with enough oil for deep frying.
1. Warm it to smoking point.
1. To shape the vadais, first wet your hands.
1. Take a small lump of batter and bind it together between your palms, then flatten it into a 1" round patty using your fingers.
1. Slip it gently into hot oil and fry until golden brown on both sides.
1. Fry vadai in batches over moderate heat turning frequently till the Vadai is golden and crisp.
1. Drain them on a kitchen towel.
1. To prepare the kuzhambu, place a pan over medium heat and warm some oil for tempering in it.
1. Add Vadagam (if using) or tempering ingredients and saute lightly for 30 seconds till it starts sputtering.
1. When the Vadagam or mustard seeds splutter, add shallots, garlic and curry leaves.
1. Saute for 3 -4 minutes, stirring continuously.
1. Add in the tomatoes, salt, coriander powder, chilli powder and toss together for another 1-2 minutes.
1. When tomatoes become mushy add tamarind pulp/juice and combine into a thick sauce like consistency.
1. If you are adding pulp, then add 2 cup of water.
1. Mix well and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occassionally.
1. Meanwhile, grind together the ingredients listed under “masala paste” into a smooth mix, in a mixer-grinder.
1. Gently mix in the prepared paste into the simmering kuzhambu and simmer over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, till well blended.
1. Next, add the Vadai one by one into the kuzhambu and simmer for just 2 minutes.
1. Switch off.
1. Masala Vadai Kuzhambu is ready to be served with piping hot steamed rice and a dollop of ghee.
