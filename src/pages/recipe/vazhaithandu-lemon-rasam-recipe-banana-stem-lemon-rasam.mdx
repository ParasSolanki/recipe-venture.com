### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vazhaithandu Lemon Rasam Recipe, whisk the yogurt salt and water in a bowl.
1. Peel the outer skin of plantain stem/Vazhaithandu and discard it.
1.  Place the cut banana stem in the yogurt.
1. This prevents it from getting discoloured.
1. Preheat the pressure cooker over medium heat; once heated, add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Add the ginger, garlic, asafoetida, curry leaves and stir for a few seconds.
1. Finally add the banana stem along with the yogurt water, the tomatoes and all the powders - coriander, cumin, turmeric, red chilli and salt.
1. Stir, cover the pressure cooker & cook for about 3 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Release the pressure immediately, either by lifting the weight with a fork or by placing the cooker under cold water.
1. Once done, open the cooker and stir in the cooker dal and squeeze in the lemon juice.
1. Add a little water and salt and chilli if required according to your taste.
1. Bring the Vazhaithandu Lemon Rasam Recipe to a brisk boil and allow it to froth up - this will take about 4 to 5 minutes.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and stir in the chopped coriander leaves and stir.
1. Serve the Vazhaithandu Lemon Rasam along with a bowl of steamed rice and a Andhra Style Beetroot Vepudu Recipe (Stir Fried Beetroot) for a lunch or a quick and wholesome weeknight dinner.
