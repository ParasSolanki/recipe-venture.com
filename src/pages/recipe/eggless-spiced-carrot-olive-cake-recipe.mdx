### Ingredients

- 2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1/2 cup Icing Sugar.
- 2 teaspoons Baking powder.
- 2 tablespoons Flax seed powder (flax meal).
- 6 tablespoons Chilled water.
- 2 teaspoons Water.
- 1 cup Carrots (Gajjar) - grated.
- 1/2 cup Walnuts - chopped.
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Carrot Cake Recipe, first preheat oven 180 C.
1. Grease and flour a 9 inch spring foam pan or a bread loaf pan or a bundt pan.
1. Keep aside.
1. To make the Flax meal Egg Replacer If your recipe asks for 2 eggs, measure 2 tablespoons of flax meal along with 6 tablespoons of water.
1. Stir well and let the mixture rest for about 15 minutes.
1. This process of resting helps the flax meal mixture develop a gelatinous consistency similar to eggs.
1. To make the batter Sift the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and keep aside.
1. In a large bowl or the bowl of the stand mixer; beat together the oil, sugar and eggs (flaxmeal egg replacer) until light and fluffy.
1. Gradually add in the flour mixture and the carrots and beat until well combined.
1. Fold in the walnuts and spoon the batter into the prepared cake pan and place it to bake in the preheated oven.
1. Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes or until when a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.
1. Once the cake is baked, remove from the oven.
1. You can serve the Spiced Carrot Cake as it is or along with a glaze or cream cheese topping.
1. Method for the Quick GlazeIn a small bowl, mix 1/2 cup confectioners sugar and 1 to 2 tsp water until smooth but thick glaze forms(too thin will be absorbed by the cake).
1. Place a piece of waxed paper under cooling rack for easy cleanup.
1. Spoon glaze back and forth over the cake forming a zig zag pattern.
1. Keep the cake on the cooking rack until glaze is set about 15-20 minutes.
1. Or you can optionally whisk some cream cheese along with icing sugar and spread it over the carrot cake.
