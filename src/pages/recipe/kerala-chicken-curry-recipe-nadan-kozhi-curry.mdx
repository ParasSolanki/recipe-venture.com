### Instructions

1. To begin making Kerala Chicken Curry Recipe, we need to first marinate the chicken.
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces along with red chilli powder, turmeric powder, salt and rub the spices well on the chicken pieces.
1. Set aside for an hour.
1. In a kadai, add 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and heat on medium heat.
1. When the oil is hot, add thinly sliced onions and the curry leaves.
1. Add a pinch of salt while saut√©ing the onions, this helps in speeding up the process of the onions browning.
1. This will take about 5-7 minutes.
1. Once the onions are brown, add crushed ginger and garlic.
1. Stir till the raw smell goes away.
1. Add in chopped tomatoes, saute till tomatoes turn mushy.
1. Next add in the spices- red chilli powder, coriander powder, fennel powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, salt and mix the ingredients well.
1. Once the oil starts to separate from the sides, add in the marinated chicken pieces along with the marinade and toss gently until the Kerala chicken is well coated with the masalas.
1. Cover with a lid and cook the Kerala Chicken Curry on low flame for about 10 to 12 minutes.
1. Stir in between.
1. If it's dry, add two tablespoons of water and give a stir.
1. Pour thick coconut milk and adjust salt and allow to boil on medium flame.
1. Adjust the consistency of the Kerala Chicken Curry to your choice, and switch off the flame.
1. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.
1. Cover the Kerala Chicken Curry and allow to rest for the flavours to get incorporated into the chicken.
1. Serve Kerala Chicken Curry Recipe along with Nei Choru or even Malabar Parotta for a delicious weekday lunch.
