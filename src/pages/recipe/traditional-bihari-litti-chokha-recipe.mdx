1. To begin making the Traditional Bihari Litti Chokha Recipe, we will first get all the ingredients ready and keep it by the aside.
1. In a large mixing bowl, sieve flour, salt and baking soda in a large bowl.
1. Add ajwain and ghee and mix everything well until you get coarse crumbs.
1. Add warm water little at a time and knead to make a firm dough and smooth dough.
1. Cover the dough in a wet muslin cloth and keep aside for 20 minutes.
1. While the dough is resting, we will prepare the filling (pitti)In a large mixing bowl, mix sattu, ajwain, kalonji, fennel seeds, mustard oil, grated ginger, garlic, green chilies, coriander, salt and lemon juice.
1. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. If you find the mixture too dry, add a little water to make a lumpy mix (which is still dry and not completely wet).
1. Keep this pitti mixture aside.
1. The final step is to make the Litti.
1. Place the rested dough on a flat counter and knead again for 5 minutes.
1. Make small lemon sized balls from the dough and roll it like pooris.
1. Hold the poori between your palm and fill 1 large tablespoon of pitti-sattu filling mixture into the dough.
1. Gather the sides of the poori and bring them together on top and seal the ball.
1. Press the ball gently to flatten it.
