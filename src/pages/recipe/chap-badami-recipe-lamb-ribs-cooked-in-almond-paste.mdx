### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chap Badami recipe, for the marinade.
1. In a deep bowl add in all the spice powders (under marinade) plus vinegar and rub the mixture into the meat.
1. Next add the papaya & whisked curd, mix well.
1. Set aside for  at least 2hrs or more in a refrigeratorFor the gravy masala : In a small wok/kadai - heat  1tbsp ghee/butter (not oil) and fry the almonds for 3-4mins on low flame.
1. Strain the almonds off excess ghee, cool them and grind to a fine paste by adding just about 200ml of water.
1. Set aside.
1. In the same pan, with left over ghee/melted butter, fry the chopped onions until golden brown.
1. Once cool, blend it into a fine paste & set aside.
1. (you should have about 1 cup)Heat a nice big chunk of ghee/butter in a grill girdle (or you can bake the ribs in an OTG @ 140c for 15-20mins).
1. I used a grill girdle, since it gives me more control in evenly browning the pieces and checking if the meat is well done with full freedom - which an oven lacks, since you cant keep opening it every now & then .
1. Place the meat pieces on a well heated grill girdle.
1. Ensure you spread the marinade liquid over the ribs and don't throw it away.
1. Cook until you notice the outer layer getting caramelised and the meat is well done.
1. Keep adding additional butter/brush the meat pieces with butter if you notice them sticking to the pan.
1. Once done -  Set the pieces aside and collect the leftover melted butter/ghee marinade mixture in a small bowl (which will pretty much be like a buttery brown sauce)In a deep, non stick pan melt 2 tablespoons butter/gheeAdd in the whole spices mentioned under Sauce Ingredients - let them splutter and induce their fragrance into the butter/gheeAdd in the fried onion paste, ginger paste and garlic paste.
1. Cook this onion/ginger/garlic mixture until all the water evaporates,  it should turn slightly brown and oil starts to separate.
1. Next add in the ground almond paste - turn  down the flame to medium.
1. Ensure that you are constantly stirring to avoid any sticking/burning at the bottom of the pan.
1. Cook until  all the water evaporates - leaving a thick consistency behind.
1. Be careful not to burn or overly brown the sauce base.
1. Add in the Red chilli powder basis the spice levels desired and stir well.
1. Add one cup of water and bring the mixture to a boil.
1. Once it starts boiling add the marinade -ghee sauce mixture (collected after grilling the ribs) and stirOnce the mixture starts boiling, add the grilled ribs and cook on a low flame for 10-15mins with a closed lid on, until the sauce thickens.
1. Add the meeta attar/kewra essence.
1. Do not stir too much, since the meat will fall off the ribs.
1. Serve Chap Badami along with Tawa Parathas or Steamed rice for a weekend meal.
