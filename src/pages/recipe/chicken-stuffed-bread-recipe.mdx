1. Now place the rectangular sheet of dough vertically in front of you on the working counter, with the help of a knife/pizza cutter, make cuts from 1 inch away from the edge to the end of the edges with a gap of 1 cm.
1. Make sure the cuts are even numbered.
1. Spoon some filling in the center,add grated cheese and oregano and start braiding.
1. Fold the top and bottom part of dough and starting from one end, start braiding each pair of strip (overlapping)till you reach the end.
