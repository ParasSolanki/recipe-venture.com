### Ingredients

- 1-2 tablespoons Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal).
- Onions - finely chopped as needed (optional).
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 inch Ginger.
- 1 Green zucchini - as needed.
- 1 cup Rice - soaked overnight/8hours.
- Sunflower Oil - to cook.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 2-3 Green Chillies.
- 1 cup Green Moong Dal (Whole) - soaked overnight/8hours.

### Instructions

1. To prepare Zucchini Pesarattu Recipe, Soak lentils and rice in enough water for 8 hours, drain and grind this mixture in a Blender along with green chillies, hing, salt, and ginger.
1. Carefully add a little water while grinding, since the lentils soak up a lot of water.
1. Now slice the zucchinis very thinly if possible using a mandolin slicer.
1. Heat a Dosa tawa on medium flame.
1. Dip the Zucchini in the dosa batter just like Bajji/Bajjias and place one in the centre and place more zucchinis dipped in batter around the center next to each other to form a flower-like pattern on a moderately hot tava that has been seasoned with oil.
1. Fill the gaps with little batter, drizzle some oil, cover and cook the dosa on a low to medium flame.
1. Cook a little extra since you need the vegetable to cook through.
1. Now gently flip the dosa and cook on the other side.
1. Top with chopped onions and Serve Zucchini Pesarattu Recipe with Allam Pachadi (Ginger Chutney).
