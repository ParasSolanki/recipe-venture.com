### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Lemon juice.
- Mixed nuts - like flaked almonds and pistachios for garnish.
- 1/3 cup Condensed Milk.
- 1 cup Sugar.
- 1 1/2 liter Milk.
- 4 Cardamom (Elaichi) Pods/Seeds.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Angoori Rasmalai, we will first have to make the chena or the cottage cheese for the rasmalai.
1. Heat 1 liter of the milk in a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Allow the milk to come to a brisk boil.
1. Once the milk comes to a brisk boil, pour in the lime juice and give the milk a stir.
1. Turn off the heat.
1. You will notice that the milk curdles immediately after the addition of the lemon juice and clear whey will separate.
1. Strain the chena in a muslin cloth strainer and allow the excess liquid to drain out.
1. Let it rest in the strainer for about an hour.
1.  After a couple of hours you will notice the chena is separated from all its whey.
1. Place the chena in a wide mixing bowl and begin to knead the chena with the heel of your palm.
1. Knead well for about 5 to 10 minutes until you get a really smooth dough.
1. Make small bite size balls of the chena dough.
1. Roll the chena balls between your palm to make the outer surface smooth.
1. This will be your angoori (grape sized) rasmalai balls.
1. Boil the 3 cups of water and the sugar in a wide pressure cooker.
1. Add 2 powdered green cardamoms in it.
1. Once the syrup comes to a rolling boil place the chena balls in very carefully.
1. Attach the lid and cook on medium until two whistles.
1. Let the steam and pressure dissipate naturally.
1. Open and carefully take the angoori rasmalai balls out one by one.
1. Try not to crowd the cooker or the tiny balls will break.
1. Cook these chena balls in 2-3 batches.
1. Take out the balls from the syrup and gently squeeze out the syrup and keep aside.
1. While the chena balls are simmering, start boiling the remaining half litre milk in another heavy bottomed pan.
1. Once it comes to boil add the condensed milk and let it simmer on medium heat for 15-20 minutes.
1. Stir occasionally to prevent it from burning at the bottom.
1. Add the chena balls in it along with crushed cardamom powder and simmer gently for another couple of minutes.
1. Cool and serve the Angoori Rasmalai with a generous sprinkle of flaked almonds and chopped pistachios.
1. Serve Angoori Rasmalai along with Bengali Sita Bhog as desserts during the festive season pr when you have guests coming over.
1. Note: To make the angoori rasmalais in a pan make the same syrup in a heavy bottomed wide pan.
1. Once the sugar is dissolved bring it to a rolling boil.
1. Carefully drop the chena balls and keep it boiling for 8-10 minutes or till they float on the top.
1. Follow the rest of the method to make the Rasmalai.
