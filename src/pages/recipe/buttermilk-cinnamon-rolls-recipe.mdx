### Instructions

1. To begin making the Buttermilk Cinnamon rolls, first mix the flours and salt in a mixing bowl or the bowl of a food processor or stand mixer.
1. Blend them together briefly.
1. In a large measuring cup, measure 1 cup buttermilk.
1. To this add honey, melted butter and whisk together.
1. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and allow it to get frothy - about 3-4 minutes.
1. Add the yeast to the buttermilk mixture.
1. If using a food processor/stand mixer; with the food processor/stand mixer running on low speed, gradually pour the buttermilk mixture into the processor over the flour.
1. Add more water if required.
1. Allow the flour to form a soft dough within the bowl of the Food processor.
1. Or alternately, add the buttermilk mixture to the flour in a mixing bowl and knead with your hands by adding enough warm water (add little by little to avoid wrong consistency) till the flour forms a soft and pliable dough.
1. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead again for 8-10 minutes, working the dough very well, until it is smooth and elastic.
1. (If using the stand mixer, knead on a medium speed using the dough hook.
1. )Transfer the formed dough to a lightly greased bowl, turning once to coat all over.
1. Cover with a wet kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set it aside in a warm place for about 1 to 1-1/2 hours until it has risen and doubled in size.
1. Meanwhile, for the filling, mix together the butter, cinnamon and the sugars in a small bowl.
1. Grease and line a baking sheet or a tray with parchment paper and set it aside for later use.
1. Once the dough has doubled, cut it in 2 parts.
1. Dust a working surface with flour and gently roll out each dough ball into a rectangle.
1. Spread the butter-cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly on top of the rolled out dough.
1. Then, starting with the longer end, roll the dough up into a scroll, making sure to keep it tight so the filling remains inside.
1. Use a sharp knife to cut the log into 1 inch rounds.
1. Place the individual rounds on the prepared sheet, cut side down.
1. Cover the sheet with a wet kitchen towel and allow the rolls to rise a second time, for about 30 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, set your oven to preheat at 200 degrees Celsius.
1. When the rolls have risen for 30 minutes, bake them until they are golden brown.
1. (about 15-20 minutes)Remove them from the oven on a wire rack and allow them to rest for 5-10 minutes.
1. Meanwhile make the glaze.
1. Mix the buttermilk and icing sugar in a small bowl and whisk well.
1. Drizzle the glaze over the rolls using a spoon or a small piping bag.
1. These Buttermilk Cinnamon rolls make a perfect accompaniment to your cup of Beet Latte Recipes or as an after-school snack for kids along with a glass of Homemade Pomegranate Juice with Ginger Recipe.
