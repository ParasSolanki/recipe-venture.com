### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Pistachios - sliced  or almonds will also do.
- 1 cup Caster Sugar.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 6 Saffron strands.
- 2 cups Hung Curd (Greek Yogurt) - (use low fat preferably).
- 1 cup Fresh fruits - of your choice.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kesar Shrikhand Recipe, pour the yogurt into a cloth sieve or a sieve which has the tiniest of the holes.
1. Take a large enough container where the rim of the sieve will sit on the mouth of the container.
1. Place the sieve with yogurt to sit on the container.
1. Place this container along with the yogurt in the fridge for 5-6 hours or overnight.
1. Doing this strains all the water from the yogurt into the container below and makes the yogurt thick and creamy.
1. The yogurt does not get sour as it is kept refrigerated.
1. Remove the fully strained whey free yogurt from the fridge and discard collected the whey.
1. Place another large clean container where the sieve can sit on.
1. With the yogurt still on sieve; rub the saffron into the yogurt with the tips of your fingers until the color and flavor of the saffron get into the yogurt.
1. Add the sugar to the yogurt sitting on the sieve.
1. Now using a large flat spoon; briskly mix the yogurt mixture such that all the ingredients strain out through the sieve into the container below, making the yogurt smooth and well blended with the sugar.
1. With the yogurt mixture in the large container now; add the cardamom powder and whisk it well until well blended.
1. Stir in the nuts and refrigerate well for 5-6 hours before serving.
1. Serve the Kesar Shrikhand topped with nuts, fruits like pomegranate, sliced green grapes, chopped mangoes and many more to enhance the taste and making it rich and festive.
1. It makes a great dessert for parties when you cook an Indian menu.
