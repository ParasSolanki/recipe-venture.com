### Instructions

1. To begin making the Quinoa Rice Pudding With Turmeric recipe, cook the rice and quinoa with 3 cups of water on medium heat.
1. This usually takes about 15 minutes (depends on the stove top/gas settings)While the rice/quinoa are cooking, boil the coconut milk in a sauce pan on medium heat.
1. Once the milk comes to a boil, add the cardamom, sugar, turmeric and let it boil for another 10 to 12 minutes.
1. Once the rice and quinoa are done, add them to the boiling coconut milk mixture.
1. Let it simmer for 5 minutes under medium heat.
1. I use an immersion blender/hand blender to blend the mixture to get a smooth pudding like consistency.
1. Let it cool and serve with chopped nuts, fruit, maple syrup or honey.
1. The pudding can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.
1. We can add more milk or honey to get the desired consistency following the refrigeration.
