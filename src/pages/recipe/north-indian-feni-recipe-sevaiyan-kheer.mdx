### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Raisins.
- 100 grams Pheni - or one roll.
- 1/4 cup Sugar.
- 300 ml Milk.
- 2 tablespoons Almond Meal (Badam Powder).
- 1 tablespoon Ghee.
- 2 tablespoons Cashew nuts.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the North Indian Pheni Recipe, we will first get all the ingredients ready and keep them by the side.
1. In a heavy bottom pan, bring the milk to a brisk boil.
1. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes till it thickens a little.
1. Once the milk has thickened a little, add the sugar and almond powder and simmer for another couple of minutes.
1. The almond powder will help thicken the milk.
1. Add the pheni at this stage and mix well and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the milk and pheni mixture to rest in the pan for about 10 minutes.
1. This will help soften the pheni in the warm milk.
1. Transfer the Pheni to a serving bowl.
1. In a small pan, heat the ghee on medium to low heat and roast cashew and raisins until golden brown and crisp.
1. Turn off the heat and pour it over the Pheni (Kheer).
1. Serve North Indian Pheni as a dessert after your delicious festive meal of Jodhpuri Aloo, Ajwain Puri, Satvik Carrot Sprout Salad and Mirchi Ka Chunda.
