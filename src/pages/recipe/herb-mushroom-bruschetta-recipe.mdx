### Ingredients

- 3-4 Cherry tomatoes - quartered.
- 10 to 12 Button mushrooms - cleaned and sliced.
- Mint Leaves (Pudina) - half a bunch.
- Salt and Pepper - to taste.
- 4-5 cloves Garlic.
- 1 Baguette.
- 1 Lemon.

### Instructions

1. To begin the Herb Mushroom Bruschetta Recipe, let's start with making the topping for the bruschetta.
1. Blitz together mint, garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil in a food processor until a coarse texture of the herbs is achieved.
1. Alternatively, you can mince the mint and garlic with a sharp knife and a chopping board.
1. To prepare the mushrooms, heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan.
1. Saute the cleaned and sliced mushroom until all the moisture has evaporated and the mushroom is dry.
1. At this point, we will add the coarsely ground mint-garlic mixture along with a tablespoon of freshly squeezed lime juice.
1. Continue to cook for a minute and turn off the heat.
1. To toast the baguette, slice the baguette and brush both the sides with olive oil.
1. Bake the slices in a preheated 180 C oven for 10 minutes or until the baguette is golden brown and lightly crisp.
1. We can also toast the baguette slice on a pan on medium heat until it turns brown and crisp.
1. For the final assembly of the Herb Mushroom Bruschetta, top the baguette with the warm mushroom mixture and quartered tomatoes with an optional sprinkle of chili flakes and drizzle of olive oil.
