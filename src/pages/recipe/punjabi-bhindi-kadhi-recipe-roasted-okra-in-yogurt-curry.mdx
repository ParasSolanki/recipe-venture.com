### Instructions

1. To begin making the Punjabi Bhindi Kadhi Recipe, we will first start by combining all the main ingredients including curd, gram flour, turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chilli powder and salt in a large saucepan.
1. Add 2 cups of water and whisk it all together, until it forms a smooth paste without lumps.
1. Place the saucepan on medium heat and bring the Kadhi mixture to a boil.
1. While the Kadhi is boiling, keep whisking it continuously, so it becomes smooth.
1. Continue to whisk it until you notice it has begun to thicken and the Kadhi is smooth.
1. Turn the heat to low at this stage and allow the Kadhi to simmer while we get the remaining ingredients ready.
1. Next, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok; add in the cut bhindi (okra), sprinkle some salt and stir fry on medium heat until the bhindi is cooked through and has a slightly crispy texture.
1. You might want to add a little more oil if required to get the right texture of the bhindi.
1. Once ready, keep it aside.
1. Heat ghee in a saucepan over medium heat and add in the cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, and dry red chilies and allow them to crackle.
1. Stir until the red chilies are roasted well.
1. Turn off the heat.
1. Add the roasted Bhindi into the Kadhi and give it stir.
1. Next pour the seasoning (only after the Kadhi has boiled for about 5 to 7 minutes) over the in the boiling Kadhi mixture.
1. Mix everything well and your kadhi is ready to be served.
1. Serve Punjabi Bhindi Kadhi Recipe along with Bharwa Besan Mirch, Phulka and Jeera Rice for a weekday meal.
