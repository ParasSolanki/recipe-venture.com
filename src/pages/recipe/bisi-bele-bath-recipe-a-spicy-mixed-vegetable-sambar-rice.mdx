1. To make the spice powder, heat a small pan on medium heat; add in the chana dal, urad dal.

1. Turn the heat to low and roast well until the chillies begin to brown and you get a roasted aroma from the spices.
1. Next will add in the poppy seeds and coconut.
1. Continue to roast along with other ingredients for about a 30 to 40 seconds until the coconut loses its moisture.
1. Once it is roasted we will add in the turmeric powder and the asafoetida powder.
1. Stir until it combines well into the other ingredients.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool completely.
1. Once cooled add the ingredients to a spice blender and make a fine powder of the mixture.
1. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and keep aside.
1. Next thing to do, is to make the spicy vegetable tamarind sambar.
1. For this, in a large pressure cooker, we will add the tamarind water, jaggery, the drumsticks, pearl onions, beans, carrots, bell peppers, tomatoes, salt and finally the bisi bele bhaat spice powder.
1. Stir all the ingredients well.
1. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight and allow the vegetables to cook until you hear at least 2 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Since the vegetables cook very quickly, we will release the pressure by running cold water over the pressure cooker.
1. This process helps to bring the pressure down immediately.
1. Open the pressure cooker and smell the aroma from the vegetable curry.
1. You can transfer this to another bowl to reuse the pressure cooker for the next process.

1. After you hear the whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for five minutes.
1. After 5 minutes have passed, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Rice cooks in this resting period, hence wait for the pressure to release completely.
1. While we are waiting for the pressure to release, Lets proceed to make the seasoning.
1. For seasoning the Bisi Bele Bath, heat a small pan on medium heat.
1. Add in a tablespoon of ghee and allow it to melt.
