### Instructions

1. To begin making the Banana Stem Thoran Recipe, prepare all the ingredients and keep them aside.
1. Add the banana stem into the pressure cooker, add 1/4 cup of water and salt and pressure cook for 2 whistles.
1. Release the pressure immediately, by placing the cooker under cold running water.
1. It is important to release the pressure immediately, so the banana stem does not become soggy.
1. Into a blender, blend the coconut, curry leaves and green chillies into a coarse mixture.
1. Stir this mixture into the cooked banana stem and keep aside.
1. Heat oil in a tadka pan; add the mustard seeds and urad dal.
1. Allow it to crackle and the dal to turn crisp and golden brown.
1. Once done, stir in the curry leaves and turn off the heat.
1. Pour the tadka over the banana stem thoran and stir.
1. Check the salt and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Serve the Banana Stem Thoran along with Nellikai Rasam (Whole Gooseberry Rasam) Recipe and Steamed Rice for lunch or even pack it into your lunch box along with Phulkas.
