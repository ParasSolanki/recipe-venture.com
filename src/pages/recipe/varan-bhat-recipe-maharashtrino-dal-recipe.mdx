### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1 Green Chilli - finely chopped.
- 1/4 cup Arhar dal (Split Toor Dal).
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/4 cup Fresh coconut - finely grated.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Varan Bhaat Recipe we will first pressure cook the toor dal and green chilies together along with 1 cup water until you hear a couple of whistles.
1. After a couple of whistles, turn the heat to low and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Once you have turned off the heat, allow the pressure to release naturally, as the dal will continue to cook in the pressure.
1. In the meanwhile, make a smooth saucy mixture by grinding the coconut, turmeric powder and cumin seeds along with water in a blender.
1. Add this to the cooked dal and whisk it well together.
1. Add salt to taste and transfer to a serving bowl.
1. The final step is to season the dal for the Varan Bhaat.
1. Heat ghee in a small tadka pan, add the cumin seeds and asafoetida and allow it to crackle for a few seconds.
1. Turn off the heat.
1. Pour this seasoning into the dal and serve the Varan Bhaat along with hot steamed rice.
1. Note: Some people add curry leaves while tempering.
1. This is optional.
