### Instructions

1. To begin making the Triple Bean Cutlet, we have to first prep all the components.
1. Steam the finely chopped carrots and beans, along with the fresh corn.
1. You can either do this in a pressure cooker or a steamer.
1. Put the steamed vegetables in a bowl and set aside to cool.
1. Boil the potato, peel it and set it aside to cool.
1. Pressure cook the soaked beans until completely soft.
1. When the pressure releases from the cooker, pour the beans into a colander, and set aside for the water to drain completely.
1. This is important, to ensure that there is no moisture left in the beans as this will cause them to disintegrate when shaping the cutlets.
1. In a big mixing bowl, add the vegetables, potato and beans.
1. Use a potato masher to mix it all up together into a thick mixture.
1. Add the ginger, garlic , chopped onions, green chillies, coriander leaves, mint leaves and mix well using your fingers.
1. Next, season with garam masala, red chilli powder, salt and pepper.
1. Sprinkle the bread crumbs all over and combine once again.
1. The mixture should hold together like a dough now.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Gently shape the cutlets to the desired size.
1. Line them up on a tray or plate.
1. Set the cutlets in the fridge to cool for at least an hour.
1. This helps them to hold shape better.
1. When you are ready to fry the cutlets, warm a little bit of oil in a shallow frying pan, or cast iron skillet.
1. Pan-fry the cutlets in batches till they are crisp on either side.
1. Serve the Triple Bean Vegetarian Cutlet or Patty as bite-sized appetizers along with a Black Bean Burger.
