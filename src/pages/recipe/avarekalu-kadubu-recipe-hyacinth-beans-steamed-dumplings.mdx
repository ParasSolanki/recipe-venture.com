1. You can reserve the drained water to use for later.
1. Put the idli steamer on medium heat with a cup water added to it.

1. To this add 1/2 cup lukewarm water (you can use the stock of water that you cooked the avarekalu in) and mix well.
1. The mixture should be crumbly but should hold the shape if pressed tightly between fingers and palm.
1. Take a small portion of the mixture, and hold it tightly to form a ball.
1. Likewise, form small balls of kadubu with the rest of the mixture.
1. Place these kadubu into the steamer, close it with a lid and steam for about 8 minutes on medium high heat or till firm and done.
