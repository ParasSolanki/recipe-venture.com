### Ingredients

- 1 cup Green seedless Grapes.
- 2 Whole Wheat Brown Bread - white bread.
- 1 cup Cucumber - slices.
- 2 tablespoons White wine vinegar - or sherry vinegar.
- 1/2 cup Badam (Almond) - blanched.
- 1 clove Garlic.
- 1/2 teaspoon Black pepper powder.
- 1 tablespoon Parsley leaves.
- Badam (Almond) - as required for garnish.
- 1 cup Chilled water - (or white grape juice).
- 1/2 cup Ice cubes - for blanching the almonds.
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.
- 1/2 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- Green seedless Grapes - as required for garnish.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Ajo Blanco recipe, peel and slice the cucumber and mince the parsley.
1. Select white bread that is about a day old, remove the crust and tear to pieces.
1. On the other side blanch the almonds and reserve a few for the garnish.
1. Place the unsalted almonds in a pan of boiling water for 60 -120 seconds.
1. Remove from the hot water and rinse immediately for a few seconds in water and ice.
1. Rub away the almond peel with your fingers or a napkin.
1. Dry the almonds completely on a clean napkin and set aside till required.
1. Our almonds are blanched now.
1. Grind the rest of the blanched almonds in a food processor, into powder.
1. Soak the bread for about 30 seconds in just enough water to cover it, squeeze lightly and add to the almond powder in the food processor.
1. Add the garlic, cucumber, grapes, parsley and vinegar into the food processor.
1. Run the processor for 30 seconds.
1. Add the olive oil and half the cold water, the salt and pepper and run the processor till the soup is blended.
1. You may need to blend it in batches, as the liquids may overflow during processing.
1. Add as much of the rest of the cold water as required for the soup to attain a fluid but creamy consistency.
1. I like a little texture in my soups, so that they don't turn out like smoothies, and I added a few grapes and almonds in the end, running the processor for just 10 seconds.
1. Remove the soup from the processor and chill it, covered, in the fridge, for at least an hour, until ready to serve.
1. Serve cold, garnished with slices of grape, sliced almonds and extra virgin olive oil drizzled on top.
1. Serve Ajo Blanco along with Penne Pasta Arrabiata and Garlic Bread for a weekend dinner with your friends.
