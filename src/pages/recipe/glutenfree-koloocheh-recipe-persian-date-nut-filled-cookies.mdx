1. [If you are using an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar together on medium speed for about 3 to 4 minutes or until light and fluffy]In a separate bowl, whisk [I simply used a balloon whisk and whisked by hand] together the flours, salt, cinnamon, and baking powder.
1. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in two batches, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
1. Mix till a soft dough is formed.
1. [If the dough is extremely sticky, add more flour (s) to get the right consistency.
1. The dough is a soft dough but should not be sticky]Turn the dough onto a piece of cling wrap and press it into a disk.
1. Wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 to 40 minutes, until firm but still flexible.
1. Preparation Of FillingCombine 1/4 cup of the walnuts/ almonds with the dates, orange juice, honey, and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.

1. To make each cookie, break off a lemon-size piece of the dough.
1. Flatten the dough slightly and make a well in it using your thumb.
1. Place 1/2 teaspoon of the filling in the middle, then pinch the dough closed and roll it into a ball.
1. Flatten the dough gently between your palms to form a disk and place it on the lined baking sheet.
1. Press a pinch of the remaining 1/4 cup walnuts/ almonds into the center of the cookie.
1. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
