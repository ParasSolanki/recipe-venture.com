### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chilke Wali Mung Dal Curry recipe, wash and drain the split mung bean dhal.
1. Place in a pressure cooker/pan, add about 1 to 1 ½ cups of water (up to 1 inch above the dhal).
1. Close the pressure pan and cook on high.
1.  After one whistle, lower the heat and cook for about 10 minutes.
1. You can cook the dhal in a saucepan with lots of water till soft and tender.
1. Let the pressure drop on its own.
1. Open the pressure pan and mash the dal.
1. You may choose to make it into a fine paste or leave it a little coarse.
1. In a deep kadai or saucepan, heat oil/ghee.
1. Once the oil is hot, add cumin seeds and cloves; sauté for a few seconds.
1. Add the finely chopped onions along with garlic and green chillies; fry for a few minutes till the onions are slightly soft and translucent.
1. Stir in tomatoes, turmeric powder and garam masala powder.
1. Saute on medium low for a few minutes till the tomatoes are slightly cooked and soft.
1. You will start to see the oil separating from the mixture.
1. At this stage, add the cooked dal along with 1 to 1 ½ cups of water and salt to taste.
1. Give it a good mix and taste for seasoning.
1. Adjust accordingly.
1. Bring to a boil on high and once it comes to a boil, reduce to medium low and simmer for about 3 to 4 minutes till the flavours have blended well and you get the consistency you want.
1. Remove from heat, garnish with finely chopped coriander leaves and serve hot.
1. Chilke Wali Mung Dal goes well with steamed rice, any pulao or biryani and any Indian flat bread like roti, paratha, naan, puri etc.
