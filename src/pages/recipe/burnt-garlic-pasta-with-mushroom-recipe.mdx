### Instructions

1. To begin with Burnt Garlic Pasta with Mushroom, we will first cook the pasta along with salt in boiling water until al dente.
1. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it from the hot water and run it under cold water immediately to stop the process of cooking.
1. Drain the pasta from its water and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent it from sticking to each other.
1. Keep the pasta aside.
1. The next step is to make the sauce.
1. Blend cauliflower florets, salt, pepper, milk and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a mixer to make a smooth mixture.
1. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan, add the grated garlic and cook on low flame till they start changing their colour to light brown.
1. Add chopped onions into the heavy bottomed skillet and saute it for a while.
1. Now mix the chopped mushroom and cover it for 5 minutes.
1. Add 1/2 cup reserved pasta water and cook for another 5 minutes.
1. Donâ€™t let the vegetables overcook, as it will get tossed along with the pasta and the sauce as well.
1. To the same wok in which you stir fried the vegetables, stir in the cooked pasta and finally the cauliflower white sauce.
1. Sprinkle some salt and black pepper and let it cook for another 4-5 minutesSprinkle some oregano and parmesan cheese to the pasta.
1. Let it cook for another 5 minutes.
