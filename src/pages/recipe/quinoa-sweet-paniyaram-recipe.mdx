### Ingredients

- Ghee - for cooking.
- 1 teaspoon Baking soda.
- 1 cup Jaggery - dissolved in water.
- 1/2 cup Quinoa.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.
- 1/2 cup Rice.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Quinoa Sweet Paniyaram Recipe, first soak the rice and quinoa separately for at least 4 hours.
1. Then, drain the water and grind them both separately into a smooth batter with a little water, ensuring that the batter is thick and not runny.
1. Warm a pan and add 1 cup grated jaggery with 1 tablespoon of water.
1. Heat until itâ€™s melted and turns into a syrup.
1. Filter the syrup through a sieve to get rid of the sediments.
1. Add the jaggery syrup into batter and mix well.
1. The batter will thin down a bit now, but that is expected.
1. Add cardamom powder, cooking soda and salt mix well.
1. Leave the batter to rest for about 15 to 20 minutes.
1. Heat a paniyaram pan, add ghee or oil in each depression and pour some batter into it.
1. Cook the Quinoa Sweet Paniyarams till they turn light brown from one side, then flip each paniyaram using a skewer and cook them the other side.
1. Add ghee or oil as needed.
1. Once cooked and they light brown from both sides, transfer them to a plate and serve hot.
