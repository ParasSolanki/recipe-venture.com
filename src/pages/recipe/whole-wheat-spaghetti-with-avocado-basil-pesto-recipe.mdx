### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- 2 cloves Garlic.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Lemon juice.
- 225 grams Spaghetti Pasta - organic whole wheat.
- 2 cups Basil leaves.
- 1/2 cup Avocado - pulped.
- 1/4 cup Walnuts - roughly chopped.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Whole Wheat Spaghetti With Avocado Basil Pesto, first cook the spaghetti.
1. Begin by setting a large pot of water, with a little salt and a drizzle of olive oil, on a high flame.
1. Bring the water to a rolling boil.
1. Then, lower the flame and drop the pasta into it.
1. Cook for about 7-8 minutes, or as per the instructions on the package, until the pasta is cooked al-dente.
1. Drain the pasta in a colander, retaining the water in which the spaghetti is cooked, by collecting it in  in a separate bowl.
1. Do not drain the spaghetti completely, so that it does not dry out while you prepare the pesto.
1. Next, prepare the pesto.
1. In a mixer/grinder or food processor, add the basil, avocado, walnuts, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and pulse in bursts of 4-5 seconds until it is disintegrated.
1. Then run the grinder again so it comes together in a smooth paste.
1. If you need to add water to help it run better and turn smooth, add some of the water used to cook the pasta.
1. In a serving bowl or a platter, mix together the cooked spaghetti and pasta.
1. Sprinkle as much salt as is needed and combine.
1. Drizzle a little bit of the water used to cook the pasta to help mix it evenly.
1. Serve the Whole Wheat Spaghetti With Avocado Basil Pesto with a sprig of basil for garnish and a drizzle of olive oil.
1. Since the recipe doesn't use any cheese in the pesto, you can add grated cheddar or parmesan while preparing the pesto or even as a garnish when serving.
1. Serve Whole Wheat Spaghetti With Avocado Basil Pesto along with Spicy Roasted Pumpkin Carrot Soup and Chickpea Orange Salad with Sun Dried Tomatoes for a weeknight dinner.
