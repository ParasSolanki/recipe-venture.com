### Instructions

1. To begin making the Shakshuka With Oats Recipes, we will first soak the beans overnight for about 8 hours in water.
1. Place the beans in the pressure cooker and cook along with salt, until soft and done.
1. Follow How to Cook Lentils (Dals/Pulses) in a Pressure Cooker to cook the beans.
1. Once the beans are cooked, open the cooker and drain out the excess liquids.
1. Reserve the drained liquid for later.
1. Our next step is to spice the beans up to make the baked beans.
1. Heat oil in a saucepan on medium heat; add in the onions and garlic and saut√© until the onions are tender.
1. Add the tomatoes, honey and the spices like the chilli powder, oregano, pepper powder, cumin powder, salt to taste and give it a stir.
1. Add in the cooked drained beans into the tomato gravy.
1. Stir fry the beans until the beans get well coated with the tomatoes.
1. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer the beans until you notice the beans are well coated with the spices and tomatoes.
1. Check the salt and seasoning and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Now we will proceed to make the Shakshuka.
1. Heat a skillet pan over medium heat.
1. Add the baked beans, oats and the drained water from the beans to the skillet and bring it to a brisk boil.
1. Gently break  the eggs directly on to the beans and do not mix at all.
1. Lower the heat, cover and allow the entire mixture to slowly cook until the eggs are cooked through.
1. When the eggs are no longer translucent, turn off the heat and garnish the Shakshuka with freshly chopped coriander and serve.
1. Serve the Shakshuka With Oats Recipes with  Whole Wheat Rosemary Focaccia Bread Recipe by the side for a wholesome breakfast or dinner.
1. You can also pair it up with a nice refreshing drink like Orange Mocktail Recipe.
