### Ingredients

- Ghee - for cooking.
- Sunflower Oil.
- 1 cup Milk.
- Salt - a pinch.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 6 Saffron strands.
- 1/4 teaspoon Nutmeg powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mande Roti Recipe, heat milk with saffron till luke warm.
1. Allow the saffron to blend into the milk to form the yellow color.
1. Mix all the ingredients together and knead it into a soft dough but little sticky.
1. Rest the dough for around 10 minutes.
1. Then knead one last time and pinch out a small portion from the dough.
1. Toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter.
1. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.
1. Roll it as thin as possible.
1. Tip: It is a good idea to roll out a batch of dough so it gets easier to cook the entire batch.
1. Heat a dosa tawa so that you can cook the big roti well.
1. Place rolled dough on the hot skillet.
1. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form.
1. At this point flip the rolled dough to cook the other side on the skillet.
1. Spread ghee nicely on either side, fold to form a rectangular booklet and serve hot.
1. Serve the Mande Roti Recipe along with Pakistani Bhuna Gosht Recipe and  end it with Creamy Phirni to make it a complete meal.
