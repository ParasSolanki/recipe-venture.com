### Instructions

1. To begin making the Paneer Stuffed Bread Fritters, first lets first make the paneer bhurji.
1. In a pan, on medium heat, warm a tablespoon of oil.
1. Add jeera and let it sizzle.
1. Next, add chopped green chillies and then crumbled paneer to this.
1. Toss together and mix, then sprinkle the amchur powder, garam masala powder, salt and give it a good mix once again.
1. Cook it for another 2 minutes.
1. Switch of the heat and let the mixture cool.
1. Add the prepared bhurji into a mixing bowl, add chopped onions, mashed potato and coriander leaves to this and knead the mixture well.
1. Make lemon size balls out of this mixture.
1. This should make around 12 to 14 balls.
1. In a deep pan or kadai warm the oil to deep fry the fritters.
1. In a deep plate add half the milk.
1. Chop the sides of the sliced bread and lay the bread slices one at a time, in the milk.
1. Let the bread soak in the milk for a few seconds, then place it between your palms and gently squeeze flat till the milk is drained.
1. Keep the slice as flat as possible so as not to break it.
1. Now place the paneer mixture in the centre of the milk soaked slice, and bring the corners together to cover it with the soaked bread slice.
1. Roll the fritter between your palms to make it a smooth ball.
1. Sprinkle some semolina over it or roll it in a plate of semolina to encrust it.
1. When the oil is warm, slowly slide the fritters into the kadai, taking care not to add too many and overcrowd the pan.
1. Gently fry on a medium heat till the fritters are golden.
1. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and serve hot with Pudina Chutney as an appetiser or with Ginger Cardamom Chai to perk up your tea time.
