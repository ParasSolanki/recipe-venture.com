### Ingredients

- 1 inch Ginger - grated.
- 1 teaspoon Light soy sauce.
- 1/2 teaspoon Sesame (Gingelly) Oil.
- 1 or 2 Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- 2 to 3 Spring Onion (Bulb & Greens) - finely chopped with leaves.
- 1 clove Garlic - finely chopped.
- 8-10 Momos - only filled and shaped.
- 1 teaspoon Rice Vinegar.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vegetable Wonton Soup, first get the momos ready.
1. Do not steam them, as we will be cooking it in the soup base.
1. Keep the filled.
1. Keep the filled non-steamed momos covered with a damp muslin cloth until we make the soup broth.
1. To begin making the soup broth, heat the sesame oil in a wide saucepan.
1. Add the onions, ginger, garlic and green chillies and saute for a few seconds.
1. Next add in 3 cups of water, salt, vinegar, soy sauce.
1. Give the broth a simmer for about 10 minutes so all the flavours from the ginger, garlic and onions get into the soup broth.
1. Give the soup broth a taste and check for salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Once the soup broth has simmered for about 10 minutes, we will add the non-steamed wontons/momos to the broth.
1. Gradually add all of them and increase the heat of the soup.
1. Bring the soup to a boil and allow the wontons to cook in the broth for about 5 minutes.
1. You will notice the wontons come floating to the top.
1. At this stage turn off the heat.
1. Spoon the Vegetarian Wonton Soup in a bowl and serve it with Cantonese Style Vegetarian Chowmein for a filling weeknight dinner.
