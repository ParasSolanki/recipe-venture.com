### Ingredients

- Curry leaves - handful.
- 2 cups Mixed vegetables.
- 2 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 1/2 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 3 Dry Red Chillies.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1/2 cup Fresh coconut - grated.
- 2 tablespoons White Urad Dal (Split).
- 2 Dry Red Chillies.
- 1 teaspoon Coconut Oil.
- 1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1/2 cup Arhar dal (Split Toor Dal).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mulakootal recipe, firstly wash, peel and dice all vegetables.
1. You can use any vegetables you have at home.
1. I like to use vegetables like carrot, lauki, drumstick, beans, potato, white pumpkin and cauliflower.
1. In a large pot (use an earthen pot if you have, the flavour is lovely)or in a pressure cooker, boil all the vegetables with little water with salt and turmeric.
1. In an another pressure cooker, boil the toor dal and keep it aside.
1. Dry roast all the ingredients for the paste apart from coconut for 2-3 minutes till fragrant and slight brown.
1. Grind together coconut and the roasted spices to a smooth paste adding little water if required.
1. Add the toor dal and coconut paste to the boiled vegetables and let it simmer further for 5 minutes till the flavours have blended and the raw smell of coconut has gone.
1. In a small tadka pan, heat coconut oil and add mustard seeds, red chilly and curry leaves and saut√© for 2 minutes.
1. Pour this over the curry and it is ready to be served.
1. Serve Mulakootal with hot steamed rice for a perfect summer lunch.
