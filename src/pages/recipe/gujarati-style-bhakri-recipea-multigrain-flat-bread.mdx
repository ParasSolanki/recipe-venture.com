### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons Ajwain (Carom seeds) - or sesame seeds.
- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1 cup Jowar Flour (Sorghum).
- 1/4 teaspoon Dry ginger powder.
- Salt - to taste.
- 4 tablespoons Ghee.
- 1 teaspoon Whole Black Peppercorns - coarsely pounded.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Bhakri's, in a wide bowl, combine the flours, ghee, cumin seeds, ginger, red chilli powder and salt.
1. Add water a little at a time and knead into very firm dough.
1. Cover and set aside for 15 minutes.
1. Preheat an iron skillet on medium heat.
1. Divide the dough into 10 equal portions.
1. Roll out each portion into a 4 inch diameter circle.
1. Place the rolled dough on the heated skillet on medium heat.
1. Cook each rolled portion of the bhakri dough on both sides until golden brown, putting light pressure using a wooden press, so the insides cook evenly.
1. You will notice brown spots coming on very quickly if you your heat is very high.
1. So take care and cook it evenly on medium heat.
1. Optionally, many families cook the Bhakriâ€™s in ghee to make it flakier.
1. Bhakri also travels well, so if you have a long distance journey this would be an ideal bread to dip into your Masala Chai.
1. Serve the Bhakri along with Lauki Channa Dal and a bowl of yogurt for dinner or a packed lunch.
