### Instructions

1. To begin making the Tawa Paratha, in a large bowl combine the flour, salt, a tablespoon of oil and knead adding little water at a time to make firm and smooth dough.
1. Add one tablespoon of oil to coat the dough and knead again.
1. Cover and set aside for 15 minutes.
1. Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions.
1. Preheat the iron skillet on medium heat.
1. Roll the dough portions into balls and flatten them with the palm of your hand.
1. Toss them in flour and roll them out into circles of approximately 3 inches in diameter.
1. Put 1/4 teaspoon oil and spread it on the rolled dough.
1. We need to get a triangle shape, to do so, first fold into a semi-circle, then fold the semi-circle into half again.
1. You get a mini triangle shape.
1. Tossing the triangle in a little flour, roll it out gently into a larger triangle.
1. Continue the same process of rolling with the remaining dough portions.
1. With skillet on medium high heat, place one rolled out paratha on the skillet.
1. After a few seconds you will notice an air pockets popping out.
1. At this point flip the plain paratha and smear about 1/2 a teaspoon of ghee.
1. Using a flat spatula do a light pressing and turning motion to cook  the paratha.
1. Flip to the other side and press and turn the paratha in a similar way.
1. You will notice brown spots around the parathas and it will be slightly crisp.
1. Remove from heat and place on a platter or serve hot.
