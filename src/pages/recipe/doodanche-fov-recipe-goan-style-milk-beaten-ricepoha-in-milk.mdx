### Ingredients

- 8 tablespoons Sugar.
- 2 cups Milk.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi) - crushed.
- 2 cups Water.
- 1 cup Poha (Flattened rice).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Goan Style Doodanche Fov, first wash the beaten rice thoroughly under running water.
1. Then, allow it to soak in adequate water for 10 minutes.
1. Once it softens, heat 1 cup water in a saucepan over high heat.
1. When it is warmed up, add the beaten rice to it and bring it to a boil.
1. Once the water and beaten rice begins to boil, add milk and boil the mixture once again for 10 minutes stirring occasionally to avoid it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
1. After ten minutes, add sugar and stir well till dissolved.
1. Sprinkle in the crushed cardamom powder and stir well.
1. Allow the Doodanche Fov to simmer for a couple of minutes, turn off the heat and serve.
