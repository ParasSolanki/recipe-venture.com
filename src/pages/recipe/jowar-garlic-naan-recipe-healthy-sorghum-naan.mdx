### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Sugar.
- 1 teaspoon Active dry yeast.
- Ghee - for cooking.
- 1 cup Jowar Flour (Sorghum).
- 10 cloves Garlic - finely chopped.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/4 cup Methi Leaves (Fenugreek Leaves) - finely chopped.
- 1/4 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).
- 1 teaspoon Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Jowar Garlic Naan Recipe, Let us make the dough.
1. To make the dough, in a mixing bowl, combine the jowar flour, wheat flour, methi leaves, yeast, salt and sugar.
1. Start  by making the dough with all the yoghurt and then add a little water at a time and only use required amount of water to make a firm dough.
1. Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.
1. Set the dough aside to rest covered for 2 hours.
1. After 2 hours, knead once again and divide the dough into equal portions.
1. Preheat the iron griddle on medium high heat.
1. Roll the portions of dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.
1. Take a portion of the dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into oval shape.
1. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.
1. After the first roll of the dough ball, sprinkle some garlic on the surface of the dough , lightly press it down and begin to roll it again.
1. Once you got a nice oval shaped naan of medium thickness, transfer it on the hot griddle.
1. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes.
1. Then flip the Jowar Garlic Naan  and smear about 1/2 a teaspoon of ghee.
1. Using a flat spatula do a light pressing and turning motion to cook to the naan.
1. Flip to the other side and press and turn the naan in a similar way, smear ghee once again.
1. You will notice brown spots around the naan and it will be slightly crisp.
1. Remove from heat and place on a platter and serve hot.
1. Continue the similar process with the remaining rolled portions and serve hot.
1. Serve this Jowar Garlic Naan Recipe along with Tamatari Chole Recipe or Amritsari Fish Gravy Recipe and Tomato Onion Tadka Raita Recipe and Carrot, Radish & Peanut Salad with Lemon Recipe for a complete healthy, nutrition packed meal on a Sunday afternoon.
