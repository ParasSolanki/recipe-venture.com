### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Ghee.
- 1 Mango (Ripe) - peeled and pureed.
- 1 tablespoons Ghee.
- 10 Cashew nuts - chopped.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2-1/2 cups Water - depending on the consistency you desire.
- 10 Cashew nuts - halved.
- 1/2 cup Sugar.
- 1 cup Sooji (Semolina/ Rava).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mango Kesari or Mango Sheera Recipe, we will first prepare the mango pulp.
1. Wash the mango well and peel it.
1. Roughly chop the fruit into pieces and discard the seed/stone.
1. Blend the chopped mango in a mixer until smooth.
1. Put the pulp in a bowl and set it aside for later use.
1. In a small tadka pan melt a teaspoon of ghee.
1. Add the chopped cashew nuts to it and gently toast them, over a low heat until golden brown and crisp, taking care not to burn them.
1. Turn off the heat, and set the pan aside for later use.
1. Heat the 1/4 cup of ghee in a heavy bottomed pan over medium heat and dry roast the semolina (rava) gently, until it gets lightly toasted and aromatic.
1. Meanwhile, put 2-1/2 cups of water in a saucepan and set it over a medium heat.
1. Add the sugar and bring it to a boil.
1. Allow it to boil for a minute.
1. At this stage, add it to the roasted semolina slowly, in a steady stream while continuously stirring the semolina.
1. Lower the flame at this stage, and ensure that you are stirring the mixture, to prevent the formation of lumps.
1. The semolina will combine with the water and slowly coagulate into a halwa-like consistency.
1. If there are any lumps, break them with the back of the spoon and continue to stir gently.
1. Next, add the mango pulp to the sooji sheera (halwa) and mix gently.
1. Cook the sheera (halwa) for about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally until the halwa comes away from the sides of the pan.
1. Turn off the heat and garnish with cardamom powder and the toasted cashews.
1. Give it a last stir and serve.
1. Serve the Mango Kesari (Sheera) as a dessert for lunch parties or make it for breakfast as an accompaniment along with Sooji (Rava) Upma or make it as a special sweet for the festival season.
