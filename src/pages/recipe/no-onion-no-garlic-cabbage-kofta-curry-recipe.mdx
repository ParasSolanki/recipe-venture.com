### Instructions

1. To begin making the No Onion No Garlic Cabbage Kofta Curry recipe, grate cabbage and press in batches to remove excess water.
1. Collect the dry grated cabbage in a large mixing bowl.
1. Add besan, green chili, coriander, cumin powder, turmeric, garam masala, red chili powder and salt.
1. Stir well to make a dry mix.
1. Heat oil in a kadhai/wok and meanwhile make medium lemon sized kofta balls out of the mix and keep aside in a plate.
1. Once the oil is hot, drop the kofta balls carefully in the wok.
1. Do not crowd the wok, add 4-5 at a time and fry till golden in colour.
1. Collect the fried kofta balls on a kitchen towel to absorb excess oil.
1. In a separate kadhai/wok, heat oil to make the curry.
1. Add bay leaf and within few seconds add grated ginger and saute.
1. Now add besan and roast it for few seconds and immediately add the tomato puree in it and stir nicely.
1. Add coriander powder, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder and garam masala powder and fry the masala till oil starts leaving from sides.
1. Now add 2 tablespoons of curd (you can skip this step if you want) and fry for another minute or so.
1. Once the masala starts smelling good, add fresh cream and mix nicely.
1. Cook for another 2-3 mins and then add water to make the curry.
1. The curry is thick hence be careful while adding water.
1. Adjust salt and let the curry come to a boil.
1. Simmer the gas, add freshly crushed cardamom and cook the curry for another 5 mins in low flame with lid closed.
1. Once the curry is done, drop in the fried kofta balls and turn off the gas.
1. Transfer the curry in a serving bowl and add a swirl of fresh cream to garnish along with some fresh coriander.
1. Serve No Onion No Garlic Cabbage Kofta Curry with Pudina Tawa Paratha and Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita for your delicious weekday meal.
