### Instructions

1. To begin making the Dosakaya Pappu Recipe, first get all the ingredients ready.
1. Wash the dal in water and place it in the Pressure cooker.
1. Add the turmeric powder, salt, chopped onions, green chillies, chopped tomatoes, diced Yellow cucumber/Dosakaya, tamarind water and red chilli powder.
1. Add two cups of water, cover the pressure cooker and cook until you hear two whistles.
1. After the couple of whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure has released, open the cooker and give the Dosakaya Pappu a good stir slightly mashing the Dosakaya into the dal.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust according to taste.
1. Add water if you wish to adjust the consistency of the dal and transfer the Dosakaya Pappu to a serving bowl and stir in the chopped coriander leaves.
1. For the seasoning: Crush or chop garlic pods.
1. Heat ghee in a small tadka pan over medium heat and add the garlic.
1. Once garlic starts to turn light brown add red chillies, mustard seeds and cumin seeds.
1. When mustard seeds splutter, add a pinch of asafoetida.
1. Now turn off the heat and add curry leaves.
1. Pour the seasoning to the Dosakaya Pappu and mix well.
1. Serve the Dosakaya Pappu with hot Steamed Rice along with a drizzle of ghee.
1. It pairs perfectly with a Spicy Potato Roast Recipe (Urulaikizhangu Poriyal) and a crunchy papad.
