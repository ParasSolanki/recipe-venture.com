### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Sugar.
- 1/2 cup Pistachios - finely chopped.
- 1 teaspoon Saffron strands.
- 3 liters Milk - (I use 2% fat).
- 2 teaspoons Cardamom Powder (Elaichi) - freshly pounded.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kesar Pista Kulfi, we will first have to condense the milk.
1. For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.
1. Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity.
1. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.
1. This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste.
1. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.
1. Once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely.
1. Finally stir in the cardamom powder, saffron and chopped pistachios into the Kulfi milk mixture.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the kesar pista kulfi mixture to cool completely.
1. Pour the kesar pista kulfi mixture in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator.
1. The Kesar Pista Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.
1.  If you get wooden ice cream sticks in the market, you can insert them in and freeze the Kulfis.
1. Once frozen you can run the kesar pista kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release onto the plate and serve.
1. Serve the Kesar Pista Kulfi for your Holi or Diwali Party or when you have an elaborate Indian Dinner Menu planned for your parties.
1. You can also serve it to your guests during festival with some delicious appetisers like Paneer Tikka and Chaat items.
