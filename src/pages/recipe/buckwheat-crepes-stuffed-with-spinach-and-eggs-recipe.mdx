### Instructions

1. To begin making Buckwheat Crepes Stuffed With Spinach And Eggs, first make the crepe batter.
1. For this, whisk together the eggs and milk (under “For the buckwheat crepes”) in a mixing bowl.
1. Add to it, the melted ghee (or butter) and grated nutmeg, stir in the buckwheat flour, salt and mix gently, but thoroughly, till there are no lumps.
1. Set the mixture aside for 15-20 minutes.
1. To make the filling place a pan or wok on the heat, and add some oil to it.
1. When it is warm, add the onion, ginger-garlic paste and green chilies and saute together for 1-2 minutes till the onion is translucent.
1. Add the chopped spinach leaves next and toss.
1. Sprinkle salt and cook for 1-2 minutes till the leaves wilt.
1. Next, pour in the whisked eggs and stir vigorously to scramble the eggs.
1. Cook for 1-2 minutes till the eggs are still soft and moist, but cooked through.
1. Sprinkle the coriander leaves (or any other herb of choice) and turn the heat off.
1. Set the filling aside while you proceed to make the crepes.
1. To make the buckwheat crepes place a large flat non-stick/griddle/crepe pan on the heat.
1. Smear some ghee or butter evenly over it.
1. Pour a ladle full of the batter on the pan and immediately tilt the pan in a circular fashion to spread the batter evenly into a thin pancake.
1. Cook until the bottom is lightly browned, usually about 30-40 seconds.
1. Flip the crepe to cook on the other side for a few seconds.
1. When full cooked, lay the crepe on a serving dish using a flat spatula.
1. Spoon over the filling on half the crepe or a quarter of the crepe.
1. Fold over the other side.
