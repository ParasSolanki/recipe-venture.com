### Instructions

1. To begin making the 3 Beans Stuffed Quesadillas Recipe, we will make the Homemade Whole Wheat Flour Tortillas, combine the flour, salt and olive oil together in a large mixing bowl.
1. Gradually knead the dough adding a little water at a time until the dough comes together and becomes smooth and elastic.
1. Knead well for about 5 minutes, this will make the dough fluffy and soft when cooked on the skillet.
1. Divide the dough into 8 portions and shape them into balls.
1. Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat.
1. Flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.
1. Take a portion of the dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter.
1. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.
1. Cook the rolled dough as indicated in the steps below.
1. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.
1. We will now pressure cook the Rajma with water for about 3 whistle until done.
1. Switch off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally and add the black eyed peas and masoor and add some more water cook it for about 3 more whistle.
1.  Keep it aside.
1. Heat a sauce pan with oil, add onions and garlic saute them until it softens.
1. Add the pureed tomatoes and cooked beans along with some water, cook for about 5 minutes.
1. Later add spices along with salt and cook until the gravy thickens.
1. Our filling is ready.
1. Our next step is to grill the Quesadillas.
1. Preheat a cast iron skillet while we fill and prepare the quesadillas.
1. Spread butter on one side of the large tortilla.
1. With heat on medium, place the buttered side down on the skillet.
1. Spoon over some 3 beans filling over one-half of the tortilla, leaving about 1/2 an inch space from the edge.
1. Sprinkle some grated cheese over this filling.
1. Fold over the empty half of the tortilla, covering the filling, making a semi-circular quesadilla.
1. Heat this side until the bottom-surface develops deep golden-brown spots and the cheese melts.
1. This would take about 2 to three minutes.
1. Press down the Quesadilla so the cheese melts.
1. Once the bottom has turned golden and crisp, flip the Quesadilla over carefully and allow the other side to brown up.
1. Once done, transfer to the serving plate.
1. Using a pizza cutter or a knife, cut to form triangular portions of the quesadilla.
1. Serve the 3 Beans Stuffed Quesadillas along with tomato salsa, pineapple salsa and a bowl of sour curd to go along with your quesadillas.
