### Instructions

1. Method To make the doughPrepare the dough by mixing together the flour, salt, oil and ajwain/ carom seeds to form a mixture of coarse crumbs.
1. Add in water to the dough a little at a time to make a soft and firm dough.
1. Once the dough comes together knead it continuously for 2-3 minutes and cover it with a moist muslin cloth.
1. Allow the dough to rest for about 15-20 minutes.
1. Method for the stuffing of spinach paneer samosasHeat oil in a pan; add in the chopped spinach and saute on high heat until the spinach softens.
1. Once the spinach has softened and all the water is evaporated, turn off the heat.
1. Allow the spinach to cool completely.
1. Once the spinach has cooled combined all the filling ingredients along with the sauteed spinach.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Method to Fill and Make the SamosasFill a small cup with water and keep aside; this will be used for sealing the edges of the cone.
1. On a floured surface, roll each portion into 3 inch diameter circle and cut each circle into half.
1. Spread the water lightly all along the edge of the circle, fold into a cone.
1. Place one or two tablespoons of spinach paneer filling in the center and seal the edges.
1. Press to seal the edges of the samoas and use a fork and press on the edges of the dough to get the forked marks.
1. Continue to make similar cone shaped samosas.
1. Method to Deep fry the SamosaHeat pure olive oil in a heavy bottomed pan for deep frying on medium heat; gently slip in a couple of samosas into the frying pan and allow them to fry on medium heat.
1. Turn the samosas around in the oil once they come floating to the top.
1. Fry them till they turn into a light golden-brown colour on all sides.
1. Keep the heat on medium all along.
1. High heat can brown the crust faster but not make the crust crispier.
1. Continue the procedure with the remaining filled cones and drain them on absorbent paper.
1. Once done, remove them from the oven and allow it to rest for about 5 minutes before serving Spinach and Paneer Samosas hot with green chutney or tamarind chutney.
