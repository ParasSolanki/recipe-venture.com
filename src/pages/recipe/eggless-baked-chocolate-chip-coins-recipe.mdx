### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Chocolate chips.
- 1/2 cup Butter (unsalted).
- 1/2 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/2 cup Vivatta Maida.
- 1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- 1 tablespoon Milk - (optional).
- 1/4 teaspoon Baking soda.
- 1/4 teaspoon Baking powder.
- 1/2 cup Caster Sugar.
- Sunflower Oil - to brush.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Eggless Baked Chocolate Chip Coins Recipe, add powdered sugar, butter (at room temperature) and vanilla sugar to a wide mixing bowl and with a hand blender, whisk well until creamy.
1. I whisked manually and it took me about 5 to 10 minutes.
1. Sieve wheat flour, all purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder into this butter mixture so that it combines well and make a pliable dough.
1. Add little amounts of milk only if the flour doesn't come together.
1. Do not knead.
1. Finally, add chocolate chips and mix well.
1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C for about 10 or 15 minutes.
1. Brush oil/butter on a baking tray.
1. Scoop out a teaspoon of the prepared dough, make a ball and flatten it slightly in between your palms and place it on the baking tray.
1. Leave some space between the coins as they spread out while baking.
1. You should get around 20 coins.
1. Bake for 30 minutes.
1. If you make thin coins, baking time would be less.
1. So, keep monitoring in between to avoid overcooking.
1. After 30 minutes, take the baking tray out of the oven and let the coins cool down completely.
1. Then you can store them for upto a week or more.
1. Serve Eggless Baked Chocolate Chip Coins Recipe during tea time with Masala Chai Recipe - Indian Spiced Tea.
