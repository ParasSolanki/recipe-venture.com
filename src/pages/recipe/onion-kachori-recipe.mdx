### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pyaaz Kachori Recipe, first add flour, salt and ghee into a mixing bowl and and mix them well.
1. Mix till you get a mixture which holds together into a ball and when left breaks apart.
1. Add more ghee if required.
1. Then, add water gradually, and knead into a soft dough.
1. Knead well until it comes into a smooth and soft dough.
1. Cover it and let the dough rest for about 1 to 2 hours.
1. While the dough rests, we will prepare the filling for the kachori.
1. Heat a heavy bottomed pan and add 1 tablespoon of mustard oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add hing and fennel seeds to it and allow them to sizzle.
1. Next, add finely chopped onions, ginger, garlic and green chilies and saut√© until onions turn translucent.
1. Once done add the mashed potatoes and all the spice powders including red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, amchur powder, salt to taste and mix well.
1. Stir in the coriander leaves and turn off the heat and let the filling of kachoris cool down completely.
1. To make the KachorisTake the rested dough and lightly knead it on a clean flat surface till it is smooth.
1. Divide the dough and the filling into an equal number of portions.
1. Place a heavy bottomed pan with enough oil to deep fry the kachoris, on the heat and allow it to heat.
1. Roll one portion of the dough into smooth ball and then flatten it into a 3-inch circle.
1. Place a portion of the filling in the center.
1. Bring all the edges to gather and seal it tightly.
1. Flatten this stuffed ball into a 3 inch circle with your fingers,press gently to keep the filling intact.
1. Keep aside and repeat this step for rest of the dough until all the portions of dough and filling are used.
1. By now the oil should be warm for deep frying the kachoris.
1. Deep fry small batches (not more than 2-3) of kachori on medium heat for about 3 minutes on either side, until golden, puffed up and crispy.
1. Take them out and put it on a kitchen towel so that the extra oil is absorbed.
1. Serve hot.
