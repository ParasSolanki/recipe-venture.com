### Ingredients

- 2 cups Caster Sugar.
- 150 grams Khoya (Mawa).

### Instructions

1. We begin making Besan Barfi Recipe, in a deep non stick pan or kadai add mawa/ khoya and roast on medium heat until you observe a slight change in colour and turns aromatic.
1. Scoop it into a bowl and set it aside.
1. Now to the same pan, add the ghee and oil.
1. You can add only ghee as well.
1. Allow it to heat up slightly.
1. Add the gram flour and roast on medium heat stirring continuously.
1. After four to five minutes, you can observe that the gram flour turning frothy and bubbly.
1. Continue stirring and roasting for 6 to 8 minutes or until the froth settles, most of the bubbles disappear.
1. And also until its aroma is felt and turns golden in colour.
1. Now sprinkle a few drops of water (1to 1-1/2 teaspoons) precisely after which tiny white bubbles will be formed.
1. This makes the flour slightly grainy that helps in its texture.
1. Continue roasting on medium heat until all the droplets disappear say for about 4 to 5 minutes.
1. Later turn off the heat and the place the pan over cold water bath (pan or a larger plate filled with water upto an inch or two depending on the size of your kadai/pan) to cool the mixture until Luke warm.
1. Once the mixture is cooled add the roasted mawa/khoya.
1. Work with the wooden spatula or spoon and ensure to mix it thoroughly without any lumps.
1. Now add the powdered sugar and cardamom powder.
1. Blend them well with mawa and besan mix.
1. This might take a little effort, if you're unable to mix it with spoon or spatula, use your hands.
1. Grease and line a square pan with parchment with hanging ends.
1. As it helps to remove the set dessert mixture in one go and eases the process of cutting into shapes.
1. Press the dessert mix on to the lined pan levelling its top with back of a spoon or bowl or glass for that matter any flat object to a smooth and even surface.
1. Set the pan in a dry place for about 20 minutes and not more.
1. Later holding the hanging edges of the parchment remove it from the pan on to a flat surface.
1. Trim it's uneven edges if any, and cut into desired shapes using a knife or pizza cutter.
1. Remove them on to a serving plate, garnish with chopped nuts and serve.
