### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Poha (Flattened rice).
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/2 cup Horse Gram Dal (Kollu/ Kulith).
- Sunflower Oil - as required for greasing.
- 1/2 cup White Urad Dal (Split).
- 1 teaspoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).
- 1 1/2 cups Foxtail Millet.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Horsegram And Foxtail Millet Idli recipe, wash and Soak Urad dal with methi seeds with enough water in a bowl for 6 hours or overnightLikewise, wash the horse gram and millets separately, soaking each of them in different bowls.
1. Soak them for a minimum of 6 hours or leave it overnight.
1. Wash the soak the poha in a bowl of water for 20 minutes before grinding the idli batter.
1. Transfer the urad dal and methi seeds into a mixer-jar and grind into a smooth paste using a little water.
1. Transfer this into a mixing bowl in which the batter will be mixed and set aside.
1. Next transfer the horse gram into a mixer-jar and grind into a smooth paste using a little water.
1. Add this to the bowl having the ground urad dal.
1. Likewise grind the millets along with the poha and transfer it to the bowl in which the batter is going to be mixed.
1. Bring all the ground mixtures together in a bowl and mix thoroughly to get a uniform batter.
1. Rest and ferment for 8-10 hours in a warm place.
1. Once the batter is fermented, add salt and water if required to adjust the consistency.
1. We need a batter of dropping  consistency to make the idlis.
1. Once you have the fermented  Idli batter, grease the Idli Steamer Plates with a little oil.
1. Pour spoonfuls of the idli batter into these moulds.
1. Do make sure you fill the idli batter only half way through as they will rise up to the top when steamed.
1. Once all the plates are filled, place the filled idli racks one above the other making sure the holes are facing the filled portion.
1. Prepare the idli steamer with a little water in the bottom.
1. Place the filled idli racks in the steamer.
1. Place the steamer on high heat and steam the idliâ€™s for 10 minutes.
1. After 10 minutes of steaming, turn off the heat.
1. Open the steamer and insert a knife or a pick to test whether the idli's are cooked.
1. If nothing sticks then the idlis are perfectly steamed.
1. Now you can remove the idli from the steamer.
1. Have a small bowl filled with water.
1. Dip a spoon in the water and then scoop the idli out starting from the edges.
1. Dipping the spoon in water helps in the easy removal of idli from the plates.
1. Pair Horsegram And Foxtail Millet Idli with Mysore Chutney and Keerai Sambar for a delicious breakfast.
