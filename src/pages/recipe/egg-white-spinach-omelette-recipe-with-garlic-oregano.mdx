### Ingredients

- 2 Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- Salt and Pepper - to taste.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Egg White Spinach Omelette Recipe With Garlic & Oregano, get all the ingredients ready before you begin making the omelette.
1. Since we are using whites from 4 eggs, this can at most serve 2 people of you plan to split the omelette into half or just about one large omelette for one person.
1. If you are making this for more people, then you would need to make it in batches of similar quantity as mentioned in the above ingredient list.
1. Take a large bowl, add all the ingredients together and whisk well with a fork until combined.
1. The egg whites would have blended well and turned little fluffy.
1. Preheat an 8 inch Omelette Skillet,  spoon the Nutralite Garlic & Oregano Spread in the skillet.
1. Once the skillet is heated, pour the whisked egg white omelette mixture onto the skillet.
1. Turn the heat to medium low, else the omelette will brown faster at the bottom than it can get cooked on the top.
1. Once you notice the top of the Omelette begins to get cooked (you will know when the wetness has turned to dry), using a flat spatula, flip the omelette and cook the opposite side as well.
1. Allow it to cook for a about a minute and once cooked well on both sides as per your preference, slide the omelette to the serving platter.
1. Serve Egg White Spinach Omelette Recipe With Garlic & Oregano with with slices of buttered whole wheat bread, a glass of Carrot Pineapple Orange Juice Recipe or Cantaloupe (Melon) Juice Recipe for breakfast or for  an after school snack.
