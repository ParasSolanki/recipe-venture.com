### Ingredients

- 2 Plantain Stem - cut into cubes.
- 1 teaspoon White Urad Dal (Split).
- 1 Dry Red Chilli.
- 3 tablespoons Fresh coconut - grated.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 2 teaspoons Whole Black Peppercorns.
- 1 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 2 teaspoons Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal).
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 2 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vazhakkai Milagu Kootu , make cuts on the layer of banana stem and then discard the outer covering.
1. Slice the banana stem and as you do, you will find the fibre coming out every time you slice into stem, keep taking them out while proceeding.
1. Once sliced, take each slice and chop them to about 1 cm pieces and then keep it immersed in a bowl of water until further use to avoid discolouration.
1. To make the pepper masala, heat oil in a small tadka pan, add the chana dal, pepper corns, asafoetida, red chilli and roast till the dal becomes golden brown.
1. Add this to the mixer jar, add the grated coconut, cumin seeds and make a smooth paste adding little water at a time.
1. Keep aside.
1. Drain the cut plantains from water and add it to a saucepan, add a cup of water, season with salt and cook until soft.
1. This will take around 10 minutes.
1. To this add the prepared pepper masala, mix well and let it simmer for 5 minutes.
1. Now, make a tadka by heating oil in a small todka pan, add the mustard seeds, urad dal, red chilli, curry leaves.
1. Once it splutters, add this to the simmering Vazhakkai Milagu Kootu, mix well and switch off the heat and serve hot.
1. Serve this Vazhakkai Milagu Kootu, along with Steamed Rice and Jeera Rasam for a simple meal for a weekday lunch.
