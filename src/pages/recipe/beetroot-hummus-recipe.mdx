### Ingredients

- 1 cup Kabuli Chana (White Chickpeas).
- 1 tablespoon Black pepper powder.
- 1 tablespoon Tahini.
- 4-5 Basil leaves.
- Salt - to taste.
- Lemon juice - from one lemon.
- 4 Beetroots.
- 10 cloves Garlic.
- 1/4 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Beetroot Hummus, first soak the chickpeas over night, or at least 6-8 hours till they double in size.
1. Then, pressure cook them with a pinch of salt till they are softened.
1. Pre-heat the oven at 200 C for 15 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, wash the beetroots thoroughly and peel the skins off them.
1. Chop them into one inch cubes and place them on a baking tray, lined with aluminium foil.
1. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon of olive oil over the cut beets,  sprinkle some salt and toss well till coated.
1. Place the tray in the oven and roast the beetroots for fifteen minutes.
1. Toss the pieces of beetroot around once in between so they get evenly roasted.
1. When the beetroots have roasted, take them out of the oven and set them aside to cool completely.
1. Place the beetroots, chickpeas and the peppercorns, basil, garlic, lemon juice and tahini into a blender add all the ingredients and pulse to break them down.
1. Drizzle the olive oil little at a time, adding a little water to help blend it easily.
1. This will bring the blended mixture together.
1. Adding the olive oil and water slowly, a little at a time helps in arriving at the right consistency slowly, or you run the risk of getting a watery hummus.
1. Once you get a creamy, smooth hummus of the consistency you desire, transfer the mixture into a serving bowl.
1. Sprinkle some herbs and serve.
1. Serve the Beetroot Hummus with Salad.
