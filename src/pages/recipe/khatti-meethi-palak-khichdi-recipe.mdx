### Instructions

1. To begin making the Khatti Meethi Palak Khichdi first prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. We will cook the palak separately and then add it to the khichdi.
1. This will help retain the nutrition and the fresh green colour of the palak.
1. Add the chopped palak into the pressure cooker, add 2 tablespoons of water, cover the pressure cooker and cook until you hear 2 whistles.
1. After 2 whistles turn off the heat.
1. release the heat from the pressure cooker either by rinsing it under cold water or by lifting the weight with a fork to release the pressure.
1. Releasing the pressure immediately helps retain the fresh green colours of the palak.
1. Open the pressure cooker and keep the palak aside.
1. Next step is to make the Khatti Meethi Palak Khichdi.
1. Rinse the rice and toor dal in water, drain excess water and keep aside.
1. Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee in the pressure cooker over medium heat.
1. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Add the cinnamon stick and bay leaves and stir for a few seconds.
1. Add the ginger, tomatoes, green chillies, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, asafoetida and saute until the tomatoes become slightly soft.
1. Add the washed rice and dal, salt, jaggery, 4 cups of water and cover the pressure cooker.
1. Pressure cook the Khichdi for about 4 to 5 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally as the khichdi will continue to cook while the pressure is present.
1. Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and stir in the cooked palak/ spinach.
1. Stir in the lemon juice and the additional ghee and give it a brisk boil for 2 minutes.
1. Turn off the heat and check the taste and adjust the salt and seasonings accordingly.
1. Once done, transfer the Khatti Meethi Palak Khichdi to a serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve the Khatti Meethi Palak Khichdi topped with ghee, sliced onions and papad for a wholesome meal.
