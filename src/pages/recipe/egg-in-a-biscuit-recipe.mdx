### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Baking soda.
- 1 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1 tablespoon Sugar.
- 1-1/2 teaspoons Baking powder.
- 2 tablespoons Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - finely chopped.
- 30 grams Salted butter - chilled and diced fine.
- 1/2 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).
- 4 Whole Eggs - boiled.
- 40 grams Cheese - grated.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Egg In A Biscuit, first set your oven to preheat at 250 C.
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside to be used later.
1. Mix all the dry ingredients like flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda in a bowl.
1. Then, put the chilled and cubed butter into the flour and work quickly with your finger to rub the butter into the dry mix till it resembles coarse crumbles.
1. Grate the cheese and add the chopped coriander leaves to the mix and combine together.
1. Mix in the yogurt and stir till the biscuit batter just comes together.
1. Take care not over mix.
1. The mix should just barely hold together and not be runny at all.
1. Over mixing makes the biscuit tough.
1. Now prepare the biscuits by dropping 4 spoonfuls of batter onto the prepared baking tray.
1. Place an egg on top of each spoonful of batter.
1. Then, encase the egg by spooning more batter over it so it is covered on all sides.
1. Place the biscuits batter along with the egg in the preheated oven to bake at 250 C for 5 mins, then reduce temp to 200 degrees C and bake for another 10-15 mins or till the crust of the biscuit is golden brown.
1. Serve Egg In A Biscuit along with Banana Almond & Prunes Smoothie for a filling breakfast or as a snack box recipe.
