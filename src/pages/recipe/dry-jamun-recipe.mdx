### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Dessicated Coconut.
- 2 cups Ghee - for frying.
- 3/4 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1 tablespoon Sugar - powdered.
- 1/2 cup Water - to make sugar syrup.
- 1/4 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 300 grams Khoya (Mawa) - crumbled.
- 200 grams Paneer (Homemade Cottage Cheese) - grated.
- 4 tablespoons Milk Powder.
- 1-1/2 cups Sugar.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Dry Jamun Recipe, we first start with making the sugar syrup.
1. Place a sauce pan on medium heat, add in the sugar and half a cup of water and boil until the sugar dissolves, turns thick to one string consistency.
1. Keep aside.
1. Now take a big bowl, add the crumbled khoya, grated paneer, milk powder, cardamom powder, powdered sugar and mix well.
1. To this slowly add in the maida and knead to a smooth yet stiff dough.
1. Make small balls of small lemon size and keep aside.
1. Now, heat the ghee in a pan and once it is hot enough fry a batch of jamun balls until it turns golden brown, keep stirring it else, to avoid burning.
1. Likewise, fry the rest of the jamun balls.
1. Put the prepared fried jamun balls into the sugar syrup that we prepared earlier and toss it so it coats all the balls.
1. Let it soak in the syrup for few minutes and remove them in a plate.
1. Now spread the desiccated coconut in a plate and slowly coat the jamuns until it is nicely coated on all the sides.
1. Likewise finish coating the rest of the prepared jamuns in desiccated coconut.
1. Serve the Dry Jamun Recipe for your guests this Diwali along with a meal of Sindhi Pulao Recipe , Paneer Makhani and Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita.
