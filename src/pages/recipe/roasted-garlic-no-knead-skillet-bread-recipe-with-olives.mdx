### Instructions

1. To begin making the Roasted Garlic No Knead Skillet Bread Recipe, we will first make the dough.
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the all purpose flour along with the yeast, salt, sugar, olive oil, mixed dry herbs, black olives, and roasted garlic.
1. Mix well to combine these ingredients and now gradually add lukewarm water to bring the dough together.
1. Use a few drops of olive oil to smoothen out the dough and shape it like a ball resembling a bread boule.
1. We are looking for a soft smooth dough.
1. Like the name suggests, this Roasted Garlic No Knead Skillet Bread Recipe requires absolutely no keading.
1. Grease a cast iron skillet with olive oil, place the neatly shaped dough, sprinkle a few drops of water and evenly brush it over the dough, now for the topping of this Roasted Garlic No Knead Skillet Bread sprinkle the mixed herbs, chopped olives and roasted garlic.
1. Cover this skillet with a deep dish ensuring that there's enough space between the dough and the surface of the dish.
1. Place the skillet in warm place, to allow the dough to prove.
1. Proving the bread dough is essentially the process of the yeast multiplying, resulting in the dough to rise.
1. Leave it aside for a minimum of 45 minutes and check if the dough has doubled in size.
1. If it still hasn't rest it until it doubles in size.
1. Remove from the warm place, put the deep dish aside, grease your fingers with oil and flatten to spread the dough to cover the surface of the entire skillet.
1. Preheat the oven to 180 degree celsius.
1. Sprinkle some sea salt over the Roasted Garlic No Knead Skillet Bread and rest it now in a warm place for 30 minutes.
1.  After 30 minutes, brush the bread with olive oil and place the skillet in the oven and let it bake for about 20 minutes.
1. Next up the heat to 200 degrees and allow the bread to get a nice even brown colour and allow the top to crust.
1. This will take between 8-10 minutes.
1. Remove from the oven and allow the bread to cool down to room temperature.
1. Cut the Roasted Garlic No Knead Skillet Bread into wedges and serve.
