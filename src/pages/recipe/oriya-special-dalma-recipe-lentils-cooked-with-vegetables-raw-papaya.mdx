### Instructions

1. To begin making the Oriya Special Dalma Recipe, we will first get all the vegetables chopped and ready.
1. We will be cooking the Oriya Dalma in one single pot - the pressure cooker.
1. Add the vegetables, dal, turmeric powder, green chillies, onions, bay leaf, salt and 3 cups of water into the pressure cooker.
1.  Pressure cook until you heat couple of whistles.
1. After a couple of whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes, then turn off the heat.
1. The dal will continue to cook in the pressure cooker as long as there is pressure.
1. Once the pressure releases completely, you can open the cooker and keep the dal aside.
1. The next step is to spice up the Dalma with flavors.
1. Using a mortar and pestle pound the ginger and garlic until you get a rough paste.
1. Heat the ghee in a heavy bottomed pan on medium heat.
1. Add the red chiles, panch phoran, the red chili powder, the garam masala powder and the pounded ginger garlic.
1. Stir fry for a few seconds until you can smell the roasted aromas.
1. Take care to keep the heat on low, else the spices can burn and smoke.
1. Add this masala to the cooked dal and give it a good stir.
1. Check for salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. You can add some water to adjust the consistency of the dal.
1. Give the Oriya Style Dalma a quick boil and turn off the heat.
1. Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with shaved coconut and the coriander leaves and serve.
1. Serve the Oriya Special Dalma as a delicious one-pot dal along with steamed rice or jeera pulao.
