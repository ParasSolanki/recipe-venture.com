### Instructions

1. To begin making Baked Whole Wheat Salsa Tart Recipe, we will first have to get the pie dough ready and refrigerate it for a couple of hours.
1. First get all the ingredients ready for the pie dough and get your butter cut into small pea size pieces.
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar.
1. Add the butter into the flour mixture.
1. Work the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
1. When you hold the flour together, it should hold tight and when you let it loose, it will fall apart.
1. Sprinkle ice water onto the flour and butter mixture.
1. Using your hands push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together.
1. Make sure to add little water at a time, as the heat from your hands will melt the butter and help form the dough as well.
1. You can transfer the pie dough onto a work surface and knead the dough until all the flour has come together to form a smooth dough.
1. Once done, wrap the dough in a cling film or a plastic wrap and refrigerate it for a couple of hours.
1. This refrigeration process helps to give the pie crust a flaky texture.
1. Once refrigerated, we are now ready to roll the dough to form a crust.
1. Preheat the oven at 180 C.
1. Place the dough on a generously floured surface and roll the pie dough into a 9 inch round.
1. Transfer the pie dough into the pie crust pan and press it down to fit the dough into pie pan from the sides as well.
1. If there is an excess dough, remove it.
1. Fork the crust all around so that it does not puff up when baking.
1. We will now pre-bake the tart crust.
1. Place the tart pan in the oven and bake for about 8 to 10 minutes until you notice the crust is turning golden.
1. Once you notice the crust is turning golden, remove from the oven and keep aside.
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients except the cheese.
1. Check the salt and spice and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Pour this Salsa mixture into the prepared tart crust, spread the mozzarella cheese on the top and place it in the oven to make.
1. Bake for about 5 minutes until the cheese melts.
1. Once the cheese melts, the Baked Whole Wheat Salsa Tart is ready.
1. Remove from the oven and wait for a few minutes before cutting it to serve.
1. Serve the Baked Whole Wheat Salsa Tart along with a glass of wine as an appetizer for your parties.
