### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mexican Sizzler  recipe, we will firstly begin with the Garlic Pepper Rice.
1. In a heavy bottomed pan, heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil, sauté the garlic well, now add peppers & blanched veggies and give it a mix.
1. Add black pepper, salt and let the bell peppers get a little crispy.
1. Now add the rice and mix once more.
1. Check for salt and spice.
1. Keep aside.
1. The next step is to make the Quinoa Patties.
1. Wash and soak quinoa in warm water for 30 minutes (I felt red quinoa took a little more time to cook).
1. Drain and cook as per packet instructions.
1. Let it cool a bit.
1. Now add in the boiled potato (mashed), onions, spices and seasonings and make a dough kind of mass.
1. Pinch out small roundels and flatten it on greased or wet palms to a thick disc.
1. Roll in cornmeal or roasted suji and clingwrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
1. Shallow fry in the required oil till they are golden brownNext, we will prepare the roasted vegetables for the sizzler.
1. Blanch all veggies except peppers and onions.
1. In a skillet, heat the remaining oil, add the chillies, garlic, peppers and onions and sauté it well.
1. Now add 1 tablespoon of each of the sauces, veggies, salt, paprika and sauté well.
1. Check for salt and seasoningThe final step is to assemble the sizzler.
1. During the last phase of your cooking, place the cast iron sizzling pan directly on the flame.
1. Let it become red hot.
1. Now place the cast iron pan on the wooden casing, arrange the patties, roasted veggies and rice, drop a blob of cold butter when it would sizzle (alternately, you can place the butter directly on the iron plate and then start assembling the cabbage leaves and on top place the three components of the dish).
1. Serve Mexican Sizzler on its own during your house parties and impress your friends and family.
1. You can also serve it along a cocktail like Cucumbertini Recipe (A Refreshing Cucumber Cocktail) or Apple And Ginger Cocktail Recipe.
