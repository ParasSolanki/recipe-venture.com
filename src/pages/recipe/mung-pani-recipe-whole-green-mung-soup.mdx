### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Green Moong Dal (Whole) - soaked for 4 hours.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/4 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 teaspoon Ghee.
- 1/2 teaspoon Black pepper powder.
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 1/2 teaspoon Lemon juice.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mung Pani Recipe, soak the beans for about 3 to 4 hours.
1. Next we will cook the mung lentils in one and a half cups of water until soft and mushy.
1. To cook it in the pressure cooker place the beans along with the water, cover the cooker, place the weight on and cook until you heat two to three whistles.
1. After two to three whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer to cook for another 10 minutes.
1. After 10 minutes turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and you will have a mushy well cooked mung beans.
1. Our next step is to puree in a blender.
1. If you have a blender that can take in heat like the one I use - KitchenAid Blender, then go ahead and blend in to a smooth puree, along with 2 cups of water.
1. If not, allow the cooked dal to cool down and then puree it until smooth.
1. Our next step is to season the Mung Pani.
1. To do this, heat ghee in a saucepan; add the cumin seeds and allow them to crackle for a few seconds.
1. Stir in the pureed mung pani, asafoetida, black pepper and salt; allow the soup to boil for a couple of minutes.
1. Turn off the heat, check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Serve the Mung Pani Soup as an immunity builder at least 2 times a week or as a soup for winters.
