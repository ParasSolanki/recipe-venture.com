### Ingredients

- Salt and Pepper - salt (coarsely pounded black pepper).
- 300 grams Baby Potatoes - halved or quartered into bite sizes.
- 2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- 2 Red Bell pepper (Capsicum) - thinly slices.
- 1 teaspoon Rosemary.
- 2 cloves Garlic - grated or finely chopped.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rosemary Roasted Potato Salad Recipe, get all the ingredients ready.
1. Its easy to work when you have the ingredients in arms reach when you are making a recipe.
1. I like roasting vegetables in wok as opposed to an oven, as wok roasted retains more moisture, make the vegetable feel a little more succulent and also gets done faster too.
1. To begin, heat the two tablespoons of olive oil in a wok; add in the garlic, the red peppers, the quartered potatoes.
1. Sprinkle some salt, and stir fry until the salt gets well combined into the vegetables.
1. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer until the potatoes get roasted and cooked through completely.
1. You will have to keep stirring the potatoes and the red peppers frequently so they get cooked and roasted evenly.
1. The above process can take between 10 to 15 minutes, based on the heat and the size of the wok and the type of the potatoes you use.
1. Once the potatoes and the red bell peppers are well roasted, sprinkle in the pounded black pepper and the rosemary.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1.  Stir fry with the herbs and the pepper for a couple of more minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Transfer the Roasted Potato & Bell Pepper Salad into a serving platter, place a few tooth picks by the side.
1. Serve Rosemary Roasted Potatoes And Pepper Salad along with a Greek Yogurt Dip - Tzatziki, and add another appetizer like Paleo Balsamic Mushrooms Recipe and a glass of chilled wine for your house parties.
