### Instructions

1. To begin making the Prawn Cutlets With Sweet Potatoes Wedges recipe, first shell medium king prawns, leaving their tails on.
1. Make a cut lengthwise of each prawn's back and remove the digestive tract.
1. Make another cut, a little deeper, so the prawn meat ‘butterflies’ open.
1. If the prawns are large, it may be necessary to flatten them gently with a wide-bladed knife.
1. To coat the cutlets, we will set up three flat plates with different mixture.
1. In the first plate, add plain flour with cornflour and flavour it with garlic powder and chilli powder.
1. Mix everything well.
1. In the second one, add 2 well-beaten eggs.
1. In the third one, add the bread crumbs and season it with salt and pepper.
1. Pour each cutlet in the flour, then dip in the egg and finally in the crumbs, pressing well.
1. Heat oil in deep frying pan and fry them on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes until they turn golden brown.
1. They cook very quickly.
1. Once done, remove the prawns from the pan and put it on a tissue paper to absorb the extra oil.
1. The next step is to make the sweet potato wedges.
1. In a mixing bowl, toss the wedges with olive oil, paprika and season it with salt and pepper.
1. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a greased baking tray and bake them for 20 to 30 minutes at 200 C or until soft and lightly browned.
1. Serve Prawn Cutlets With Sweet Potatoes Wedges on its own for a weekend dinner or with Cottage Cheese Dip Recipe with Pepper and Olives as an appetiser in a party.
