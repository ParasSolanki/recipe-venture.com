### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 5 Tomato - finely chopped.
- 1 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- Salt - to taste.
- 4 cloves Garlic - finely chopped.
- 1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- 1 Brinjal (Baingan / Eggplant) - cut into 1 inch thick wedges.
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - small bunch.
- 1 tablespoon Ghee - for cooking.
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli powder - to taste.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Baingan Tamatar Sabzi/ Baingan Masala Recipe, we will first cook the baingan (eggplant) separately.
1. Add in the cut baingan wedges into the oil, sprinkle some salt and stir to combine the salt in.
1. Cover the pan and cook the baingan on low to medium heat until it is partially cooked.
1. When the pan is covered, it develops steam that will help the baingan to cook without any water.
1. Once the baingan is partially cooked, uncover the pan and roast the baingan until it is fully cooked.
1. We open it at a stage when it is partially cooked, as we dont want the baingan to get mushy, you want it to remain firm, yet cooked.
1. So it is important to cook it without the lid in the second half.
1. Once you feel the baingan is cooked well, turn off the heat.
1. Transfer the baingan to a bowl and keep aside and we will make the masala for the baingan tamatar sabzi.
1. Into the same pan we cooked the baingan, heat a teaspoon of ghee or oil; add in the onion and garlic and saute until the onions soften.
1. Add in the chopped tomatoes and saute until the tomatoes become mushy and soft.
1. Once the tomatoes soften, add the remaining masala ingredients like turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, salt and red chilli powder to taste.
1. Stir all the baingan masala ingredients with the tomato and give it a brisk stir on high heat.
1. Add in the roasted eggplants and cover the pan, turn the heat to low and allow the baingan to simmer in the tomato masala for about 5 minutes.
1. Check the salt and adjust to suit your taste.
1. After 5 minutes, turn off the heat and stir in the freshly chopped coriander leaves and transfer the Baingan Tamatar Sabzi/ Baingan Masala Recipe to a serving bowl.
1. Serve the Baingan Tamatar Sabzi/ Baingan Masala along with Phulka's and Carrot Salad for a quick weeknight dinner.
