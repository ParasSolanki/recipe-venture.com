### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera).
- 2 Potatoes (Aloo) - boiled and mashed.
- 1 tablespoon Gram flour (besan).
- Salt - to taste.
- 100 grams Tofu - crumbed.
- 1 Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - small bunch.
- Sunflower Oil - to shallow-fry.
- 1/4 cup Badam (Almond) - powdered.
- 1 Beetroot - peeled.
- 1 teaspoon Chaat Masala Powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making making the Beetroot And Tofu Patty Recipe, we will pulse all the ingredients except oil in the food processor or blender, without adding any water.
1. Once you pulse and get all the ingredients mashed, remove from the processor and transfer to a bowl.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Shape the beetroot tofu pattie mixture into lemon size balls and flatten them a little between your palms.
1. It's a good idea to oil your palms and fingers before you begin shaping the patties, so they don't stick to your palms.
1. Once you have shaped the Beetroot And Tofu patties, we will pan fry them on a preheated iron skillet.
1. Place the shaped beetroot patties on the preheated skillet, drizzle some oil over the patties and cook them until evenly brown on both sides.
1. Once the Beetroot And Tofu Patty is cooked transfer them onto a serving late and serve.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining patties.
1. Serve the Beetroot And Tofu Patty Recipe along with a yogurt dip for your parties or along with Green Chutney Recipe  and  Masala Chai Recipe as a tea time snack.
