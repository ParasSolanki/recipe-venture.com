### Instructions

1. To begin making the Minced Mutton Spring Rolls Recipe, firstly we will mince the mutton.
1. For this, add the mutton pieces into a preethi turbo chop.
1. Pulse it until it becomes coarsely grounded.
1. The next step is to make the filling for the spring rolls: Add the required oil in a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Once the oil is hot, add the onions, ginger, garlic and green chillies.
1. Saute until the onions becomes soft and translucent.
1. Once the onions are soft, add the minced mutton and saute for another 2 minutes till the mutton changes its colour.
1. Next, add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder and salt to taste.
1. Saute well until well combined.
1. Add little water if required, cover and let it cook till the mutton keema is cooked properly and all the moisture has evaporated.
1. This will take about 8 to 10 minutes.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and add in fresh chopped mint leaves.
1. Mix well and keep it aside.
1. Your filling for the spring rolls is ready.
1. To make the Spring Roll Wrappers:Into a mixing bowl, add the all purpose flour, corn flour, salt and water to make a thin flowing batter.
1. Whisk well until smooth and there are no lumps.
1. Heat and grease a nonstick pan with oil.
1. Once the pan is hot, on medium heat, pour a ladle of the batter into the pan and tilt the pan around quickly to make a thin crepe.
1. Cook on medium heat until you see the sides are beginning to peel off.
1. When the sides begin to peel off, turn the wrapper and cook on the other side for a few seconds.
1. Do not keep the wrapper cooking for long as the wrappers become stiff and dry up.
1. Repeat with the remaining batter to make more wrappers.
1. Keep aside.
1. Next, in a mixing bowl, add all purpose flour and a little water to make a thick paste.
1. We will be using this to seal the edges of the Mince Mutton Spring Rolls.
1. Place each spring roll wrapper on a flat surface.
1. Apply a little flour paste along the edges of the wrapper.
1. Place a tablespoon of the minced mutton filling at one corner/edge of the wrapper.
1. Roll over the filling tightly.
1. Apply a little more paste around the edges and fold the sides and finally roll to make the spring roll.
1. Repeat the same process and proceed to make the rest of the Minced Mutton Spring Rolls.
1. Preheat the oil for deep frying; slide in a few minced mutton spring rolls at a time and deep fry on medium heat until golden brown and crisp.
1. Once done, remove the Minced Mutton Spring Roll onto an oil absorbent paper, so that it soaks the excess oil from the Spring Rolls.
1. It is ready to be served.
1. Serve Minced Mutton Spring Rolls Recipe as a tea time snack along with Green Chutney and Pudina Pyaz Kachumber Salad for your party starters.
