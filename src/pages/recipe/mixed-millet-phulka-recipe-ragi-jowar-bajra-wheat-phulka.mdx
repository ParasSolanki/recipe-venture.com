### Ingredients

- Ghee - for serving.
- 1/4 cup Bajra Flour ( Pearl Millet).
- 1/4 cup Ragi Flour (Finger Millet/ Nagli).
- 1/2 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt - optional.
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1/4 cup Jowar Flour (Sorghum).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mixed Millet Phulka Recipe first bring all the ingredients together and we will make the dough.
1. In a large bowl combine the ragi, jowar, bajra, wheat flour and salt; add a little water at a time to make firm dough.
1. Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.
1. Set the millet phulka dough aside to rest covered for 15 minutes.
1. Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions.
1. Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat.
1. Roll the portions of phulka (roti) dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.
1. Take a portion of the Millet phulka dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter.
1. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.
1. Cook the millet phulka as indicated in the steps below.
1. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.
1. *Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Gas StovePlace rolled dough on the hot skillet.
1. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form.
1. At this point flip the rolled dough to the other side on the skillet.
1. After a few seconds turn the flame to high; using tongs take the rolled Millet phulka off the skillet and place it directly on the flame.
1. It should balloon into a spherical shape and puff up.
1. Remove the Millet phulka from heat, place it on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.
1. Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled Millet phulka dough and keep stacking them one over the other.
1. *Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Electric StoveThis process can be used if you are using a gas stove as well.
1. Preheat an iron skillet.
1. Place rolled Millet phulka dough on the hot skillet.
1. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form.
1. At this point flip the rolled Millet phulka dough to the other side on the skillet.
1. Flip over again and cook the first side pressing lightly with a napkin.
1. The rolled out phulka dough should begin to start puffing out.
1. Flip and cook the other side for a few more seconds.
1. Remove from the heat, place the Millet phulka on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.
1. Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled dough and keep stacking them the phulka one over the other.
1. Serve the Mixed Millet Phulka Recipe with Spinach Paneer Kofta Curry and Dangar Pachadi With Grated Carrots to create complete healthy meal.
1. TipMaking the rolled out phulka dough puff into a balloon comes with practice.
1. So give yourself time if you are new to bread making.
1. Even if yours does not puff the first time or the times after, the rotis that you have made are cooked and are edible, so you could consume them with your choice of vegetables.
1. Using thinner rolling pins is the key, as you want to be gentle with the dough.
1. The heavy big ones will make you press harder which might just make it tear.
1. Itâ€™s well worth investing in a thinner rolling pin and tongs to hold the bread which is available in most Indian stores around the world.
1. Tossing the phulka dough in flour as you roll is another helper that will make the rolling out the dough easier.
