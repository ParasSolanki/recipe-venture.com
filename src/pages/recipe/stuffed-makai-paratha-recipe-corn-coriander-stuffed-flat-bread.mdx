### Ingredients

- 2 cups Sweet corn - steamed.
- 1 tablespoon Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - finely chopped.

- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera) - (roast & ground).
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Stuffed Makai Paratha Recipe, we will first need to make the dough for the parathas.
1. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.
1. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.
1. Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough.
1. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
1. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.
1. Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more.
1. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.
1. Next we will divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions.
1. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the filling ready.
1. While the dough is resting, we will prepare the filling for the paratha.
1. Into a food processor, add the steamed sweet corn, chopped green chillies, chopped coriander leaves and pulse to get a coarse mixture.
1. Transfer this mixture to a mixing bowl; add the salt and cumin powder and stir well to combine.
1. Check the salt and spice and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Divide the filling into 8 to 10 equal portions.
1. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of makai parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.
1. Take a dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down.
1. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface.
1. Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and bring the dough from the sides towards the center to cover the filling.
1. Once the filling is sealed from the inside, flatten the dough, dust it in flour and and roll it gently to make a paratha.
1.  Give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out, if you press and roll too hard, there are chances the filing will come out.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining dough and filling portions.
1. Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a Makai paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.
1. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.
1. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around.
1. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet.
1. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.
1. Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly.
1. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the makai parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.
1. Once the paratha is cooked transfer to a plate.
1. Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way.
1. The Stuffed Makai Paratha makes a perfect breakfast or even a quick weeknight dinner that you can have along with a favorite Raita.
