- 1/8 teaspoon Salt.
- 1/2 cup Lukewarm Water.
- 1 cup Icing Sugar.
- 1/2 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1 to 2 tablespoon Milk.
- 2 Whole Eggs.
- 1 tablespoon Honey.
- 3 tablespoon Butter.

### Instructions

1. To prepare French crullers recipe, add water, sugar, butter and salt into a Saucepan, and bring it to boil.
1. Once all butter is melted, add flour all at once and start stirring continuously, breaking all the lumps, until the dough comes together.
1. You will start seeing a thin coating of the dough on the pan.
1. Reduce heat and continue to cook with constant stirring for another 2 to 3 minutes.
1. We are trying to remove the moisture from the dough as much possible.
1. Remove the dough from heat, let it cool down for about 10 minutes.
1. Once dough is cooled a bit, add 1 egg at a time and keep beating with hand beater or stand mixer.
1. Beat until the egg is completely incorporated into the dough.
1. Then add the next egg and beat until incorporated well.
1. Now add 1 egg white at a time and beat well.
1. Add the next egg white, beat again.
1. Beat well until you see smooth, shiny, sticky dough.
1. Put the dough in a piping bag attached to rose (star nozzle).
1. Heat oil for deep frying in a Pan.
1. Cut a couple of 4 x 4 inch square shaped parchment papers.
1. Grease it with oil.
1. Squeeze the dough onto to parchment papers.
1. You can pipe about size 3-inch crullers onto the paper.
1. Once oil is hot (about 370 degree Fahrenheit), you can start frying crullers on medium heat.
1. Lift the parchment paper and drop it into hot oil with dough side down.
1. Wait for a couple of seconds or a minute when the dough leaves the parchment paper.
1. Using tongs to lift the paper out of oil.
1. You can add a few crullers at a time depending on the size of the pan you use to fry.
1. Make sure to fry crullers in low flame, flipping it side to side until it’s fried to golden brown.
1. Remove from oil and place the fried crullers on kitchen towel.
1. Repeat this for rest of the dough.
1. Place all the crullers on wire mesh to cool completely.
1. Now whisk together icing sugar, honey and milk into smooth glaze.
1. Dip a cruller fully into the glaze using a fork and remove it and place it on wire mesh to rest for 1 to 2 hours.
1. That’s it crullers are ready.
1. I wanted to add a little zing, so I grated a little bit of lime zest on top.
1. You can even go ahead with orange zest, grate it on top or mix it in glaze.
1. Serve Crullers recipe as a breakfast or snack along with coffee to enjoy the crispy donuts.
