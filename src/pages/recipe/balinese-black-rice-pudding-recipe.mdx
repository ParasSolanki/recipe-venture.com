### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 1/2 cup Black Rice.
- 2 tablespoon Palm sugar.
- 1 Ripe Bananas.
- 1 1/2 cups Water.
- 1 tablespoon Palm sugar.
- 1 cup Coconut milk.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Balinese Black Rice Pudding, wash and soak the black rice with water for 6 hours.
1. In a heavy bottomed saucepan, cook the rice with coconut milk, water and salt to taste in a vessel on high heat and once it starts to boil bring it to low heat.
1. Keep cooking until the entire liquid is almost absorbed in the rice and the rice gets cooked evenly.
1. It's fine to leave a little bit of liquid as the pudding will continue to thicken once it starts to cool.
1. Add 2 tablespoon of palm sugar at the end and check for sweetness.
1. Slice the banana and coat it with palm sugar on a pan for 10 minutes and keep it ready before serving.
1. Just before serving drizzle with coconut milk and add the sliced bananas and serve Balinese Rice pudding hot or cold.
1. Serve Balinese Rice pudding as a dessert after a simple Asian meal of  Vegetarian Thai Red Curry and steamed rice.
