### Ingredients

- 1/3 cup Water.
- 1 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 3/4 cup Sugar.
- Water - for kneading dough.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- Badam (Almond) - chopped (as required).
- Pistachios - chopped (as required).
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.
- Cashew nuts - chopped (as required).
- 1/2 tablespoon All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 1 tablespoon Rice flour.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chiroti recipe, we will first begin with the dough.
1. In a wide bowl, mix maida, ghee and knead into a stiff dough adding water gradually.
1. You can also use the a food processor like I have, do knead the dough and bring it together.
1. The dough should be firm and smooth, similar to that of a puri.
1. Cover and set aside for 15-20 minutes.
1. To prepare sugar syrup, add sugar and water in a pan and allow to boil.
1. Once the syrup starts boiling, reduce the flame to low and check the consistency of sugar syrup.
1. You should have a one string consistency sugar syrup.
1. Add cardamom powder and turn off heat.
1. Set aside.
1. In a small bowl, mix ghee, rice flour and maida.
1. Stir and keep aside.
1. Now, we will make the puris.
1. Divide the dough in 6 equal parts and make balls out of it.
1. Roll out each ball into a big round (big sized roti).
1. Now take 1 roti and apply ghee-flour mixture and spread evenly on it.
1. Place another roti on it and apply ghee-flour mixture over it.
1. Now, place the third roti and apply the ghee-flour mixture.
1. Then roll them up into a log.
1. With the help of a knife, cut small pieces of the roll.
1. These would now look like mini swiss rolls or pinwheels.
1. Repeat the same process for the remaining 3 rotis.
1. Lightly press these pinwheels and flatten them to form a disc.
1. These are now flattened chiroti dough, which we now need to deepfry.
1. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan for frying the chiroti.
1. Fry the prepared chiroti until it turns light golden and crisp.
1. Immediately soak these chiroti in the prepared warm sugar syrup.
1. When you dip the chiroti puris, syrup should neither be too hot nor at room temperature.
1. It should be warm.
1. Soak the chiroti in the syrup for about a minute or until it gets well coated.
1.  Take the Chiroti out and place it on a platter.
1. Sprinkle chopped nuts over the chiroti and allow it to cool.
1. Once cooled, store the Chiroti in an air-tight container and serve as desired.
1. Serve Chiroti as a sweet along with your festive meal or you can serve it your guests on Diwali along with other snacks like Instant Poha Chivda and Masala Chai Recipe - Indian Spiced Tea.
