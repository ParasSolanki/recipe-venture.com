### Instructions

1. To begin making Watalappan Recipe, grate the jaggery and keep aside.

1. Beat the eggs until frothy.
1. In a blender, add the beaten frothed up eggs, coconut milk, grated Goan jaggery, cardamom powder and cinnamon powder.
1. Blend until it becomes fluffy without any lumps.
1. Strain the mixture using a cloth or strainer and pour into a steaming bowl.
1. Finely chop the pistachio, cashew, raisins or kishmish and sprinkle half of it on the mixture.
1. Cover it with a foil and steam for 30 minutes in a steamer or pressure cooker on a medium heat.
1. Turn off the heat once it is cooked well.
1. Remove the Watalappan from the steamer, sprinkle the remaining chopped nuts over the Watalappan and serve it chilled.
1. Serve Watalappan Recipe as a festive dessert along with a complete meal of Chicken Malai Kabab Recipe, Pakki Mutton Biryani Recipe, and  Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita Recipe.
