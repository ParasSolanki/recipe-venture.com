### Ingredients

- 6 Green Chillies - oarsely ground (you can also use red chilly powder).
- Sunflower Oil - for deep frying.
- Salt - to taste.
- 3/4 cup Fresh coconut - scraped.
- 1/2 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 3 cups Rice flour.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Thenga Vada Recipe, first mix the rice flour, maida, coarsely ground chillies, scraped coconut and salt in a mixing bowl and set it aside.
1. Preheat the heat oil in a Kadai, for deep frying.
1. When the oil is hot enough, add about 1 tablespoon of hot oil to the flour mixture and combine.
1. The mixture should resemble breadcrumbs.
1. Add a little water to the thengai vadai flour mixture and mix well till everything comes together to form a firm ball of cough (similar to the dough formed for chapatis).
1. When you are ready to fry the vadai, take a small lemon sized ball of the dough and flatten it on your hand to make thin discs or vadas.
1. You can optionally grease your fingers with oil so they don't stick to your fingers.
1. Make a hole in the middle of the vadai disc with your finger so it resembles a donut.
1. Drop the thengai vadas gently into the hot oil, one by one, taking care not to crowd the kadai.
1. Fry the vadas till golden brown and crisp.
1. Then lift them out of the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper towels.
1. Cool slightly and serve.
1. Serve the Thengai Vadas along with a tea time snack.
1. You can also store them in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
