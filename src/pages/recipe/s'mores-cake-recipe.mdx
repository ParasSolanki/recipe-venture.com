1. To begin making S'mores Cake Recipe, prep up all the ingredients first.
1. *For Graham Crackers:This is adapted from The Bakefeed Winter 2017 Issue.
1. You can use the store bought ones as well.
1. In a large bowl, beat butter, brown sugar, honey and molasses till combined well.
1. In a another mixing bowl, add baking powder, whole wheat flour and all purpose flour and mix well.

1. Add the dry ingredients gradually into the bowl of the butter- sugar mixture.
1. Once all the ingredients are incorporated and thoroughly mixed and forms a tight dough.
1. Roll out the dough by dusting onto a parchment sheet to about 1/4 - 1/2 inch thickness and let it chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees celsius.
1. Cut the dough into small squares of 1.
1. 5 - 2 inches (This will make it baking evenly).
1. Bake for about 10-12 minutes.
1. Once baked, let it cool on a cooling rack, you can crack the cookies on the cuts made before baking, so they form small squares.
1. For Graham Cracker Cake:Blitz the graham crackers in a blender until it is into fine crumbs.

1. Divide the batter equally into 3 baking tins.
1. I have used 3 inch cake tins.
1. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until done.
1. This time depends on your oven, cake dish used and the amount.
1. So, using a wooden skewer, check to see if completely baked.
1. Once baked, the wooden skewer inserted in the middle with come out clean.
1. Let it cool on a cooling rack.
1. For Marshmallow Fluff:To make the marshmallow fluff, clean the bowls using vinegar or lemon juice.
1. This will help remove all the bits of grease that might be on the surface of the bowl.
1. Add One egg white, lemon juice / cream of tartar in the bowl, start beating it in a stand mixer or using a hand mixer.
1. Whisk the eggs until soft peaks are formed.

1. For Dark Chocolate Ganache:Chop the dark chocolate into small pieces, add this pieces in a bowl.
1. Heat the cream and add the cream into the bowl with chocolate chunks.

1. Using a spatula/whisk, mix the cream into the melted chocolate.
1. Let it chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or longer depending on the consistency needed for frosting.
1. Assembling the cake:Trim the tops of the cake to make them flat and uniform in size.
1. On a cake board, place a small dollop of ganache.
1. Place the bottom layer of cake on the cake board, add a layer of dark chocolate ganache frosting on top of the cake layer.
1. Place the second layer of cake on the frosting, repeat for all layers.
1. Using the dark chocolate ganache do the crumb coat on the cake.
1. Let it chill for 15-30 minutes, until the ganache is set slightly on the cake.
1. Frost the cake.
1. Pipe the marshmallow fluff on the side of the cake as well as on the top of the cake.
1. Using a kitchen torch, torch the marshmallow fluff to give it a toasty look and taste.
1. Garnish the cake with some graham cracker crumbs.
1. Serve S'mores Cake Recipe as a party dessert after a meal of Grilled Vegetarian Moussaka Recipe With Soy Granules or Healthy Black Bean Stuffed Burrito Recipe With Amaranth And Quinoa.
