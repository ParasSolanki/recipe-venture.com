1. When pakodas are cooked on one side and turned golden brown, flip over and cook on the other side.
1. Once the pakodas are evenly browned on all sides and cooked through remove them from the pan into an oil absorbent paper and proceed to make the next batch of the pakodas with the remaining batter.
