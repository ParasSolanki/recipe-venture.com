### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chinese Samosa recipe, first prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. We will make the filling and the dough first and then proceed to bake the chinese veg samosa.
1. To begin making the dough for the samosa crust, combine all the ingredients for the dough in a large mixing bowl.
1. Rub the ghee into the flour till you see coarse crumbs.
1. Add a little water at a time and knead to make a firm and yet smooth dough.
1. Cover the dough and keep it aside to rest while we prepare the chinese filling.
1. For the stuffing, heat oil in a wok or a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Add the ginger, garlic, green chilies and spring onions and stir fry for a few seconds until you can smell the aromas coming through.
1. Add the carrots, beans, capsicum and cabbage and stir fry on high heat until it is cooked through.
1. The vegetables will be cooked yet firm.
1. Once done, add the cooked noodles, that are roughly chopped, the chili sauce, salt and pepper.
1. Stir together until the filling combined with all the ingredients.
1. Check the taste and adjust the salt and chili.
1. Turn off the heat and keep the filling aside to cool.
1. Preheat the oven to 170 C and grease a baking sheet with oil.
1. Divide the samosa dough into 12 equal portions.
1.  Dust it in a little flour and roll into a small square.
1. Place a small portion of the chinese filling into the rolled out dough.
1. At this stage you can fold it like a wonton by bringing the edges together.
1. Seal the edges by pinching it well, so it gives a shape and stands out.
1. Proceed the same way to make the similar chinese veg samosas.
1. Brush each of the samoas with oil or ghee on the top and arrange it on the baking tray to bake.
1. Place the chinese veg samosas into the oven and make for about 20 to 25 minutes until it is crisp and golden brown from all sides.
1. The baking times will differ from oven to oven, so to check at the 15 minute mark to see if its done or needs to be baked more.
1. Once done, remove the Veg Chinese Samosas from the oven and serve.
1. Serve the Veg Chinese Samosa along with a Schezwan sauce as an appetizer or a evening tea time snack for parties.
