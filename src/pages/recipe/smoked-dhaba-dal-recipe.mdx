### Instructions

1. To begin making the Smoked Dhaba Dal Recipe; we will use the pressure cooker method to make the dal in one pot along with all the spices.
1. Soak the tuvar dal and green moong dal for about an hour in water.
1. Once you are through with the soaking time, get all the ingredients ready.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in the pressure cooker; add the onions, ginger, garlic and green chillies and saute for a few minutes until the onions are lightly tender and softened.
1. Add the tomatoes, and the remaining spices and saute until you smell the aromas coming through.
1. Add the soaked dals, salt and add 3 cups of water.
1. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and cook until you hear 2 to 3 whistles.
1. After two to three whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer the Dhaba Dal for about 5 to 8 minutes.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. The dal continues to cook under the pressure, hence we allow it to rest until the pressure releases.
1. Once the pressure releases; open the cooker and you will notice the dal cooked and mushy.
1. That is how we want the Dhaba Dal to appear.
1. Stir in the chopped coriander leaves and check the salt and spice levels.
1. Adjust to suit your taste.
1. Adjust the consistency of the dal, by adding water.
1. Now the final step is to add the smoked flavor and to prepare the seasoning.
1. To smoke the dal heat charcoal until red hot over the gas burner (direct flame).
1. Once the coal is red hot, place it in a heatproof bowl.
1. Place this bowl on top of the cooked lentils.
1. Drizzle a teaspoon of ghee over the hot coal.
1. The coal will begin to smoke almost instantly.
1. At this stage, cover the dal pan and allow the smoke to circulate inside.
1. This process of smoking a dal, is called Dhungar or Coal Smoking Technique.
1. After about a minute, open the dal pan and you will see the smoke effect has withered.
1. Transfer the Smoked Dhaba Dal to a serving bowl.
1. For the seasoning; heat a teaspoon of ghee in a small pan; add the cumin seeds, the slivered garlic, and red chillies.
1. Allow the cumin to crackle for a few seconds and turn off the heat.
1. Pour this seasoning over the Smoked Dhaba Dal.
1. Serve Smoked Dhaba Dal Recipe along with Garlic Naan and Palak Raita for a weekday meal.
