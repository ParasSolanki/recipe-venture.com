1. Then gently flatten it out to form a hand-patted disc, similar to Thalipeeth.
1. With your index finger, make a hole at the center of the flattened rotti.
1. This will later help to ensure that the roti is evenly cooked on the skillet.
1. Lift the paper, along with the rotti on it and turning it over, place it on the skillet with the rotti down on the hot skillet.
1. Carefully supporting the rotti peel off the paper.
1. Drizzle a little bit of oil along the edges of the roti and in the centre, into the hole made on the roti and allow it to sizzle and crisp up.
