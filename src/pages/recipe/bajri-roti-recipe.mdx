1. You can shape the roti by pressing out a circle with your fingers as well.
1. Place the roti over the pre-heated skillet and cook it for a few seconds on one side or till a few bubbles appear on top.
1. Turn over the roti and cook the other side for a few more seconds.
1. Lift the roti tongs and roast over the direct flame till brown spots appear on both the sides.
1. Similarly, prepare the remaining Bajra Rotis.
1. Serve Bajra Roti immediately smeared with white butter or ghee along with Lahsun Ki Chutney orBharva Baingan, Panchmel Dal and Mooli Raita to make a delicious lunch or dinner for the family.
