### Instructions

1. To begin making the Herbed Lentil Loaf recipe, we will first cook the lentils.
1. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil.
1.  Add lentils and simmer 25 to 30 minutes, until lentils are soft.
1. Drain any excess water and partially mash lentils.
1.  Keep the lentils aside to cool.
1. Next, preheat the oven to 180 C.
1. Lightly grease a loaf pan.
1. Add the cooked lentils and all the remaining ingredients into a large mixing bowl.
1. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Transfer the lentil loaf mixture to the loaf pan.
1. Bake until loaf is browned on the surface and cooked through from the inside.
1. This will take 15 to 20 minutes and when a tester is inserted in the center, it will come out cooked and almost clean.
1. Slice and serve the Herbed Lentil Loaf along with mashed potatoes and vegetables for a  wholesome weeknight dinner with family.
