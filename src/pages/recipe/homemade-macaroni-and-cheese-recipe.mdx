- Salt - to cook pasta.
- 2 teaspoons Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1 tablespoon Butter (unsalted).
- 1 teaspoon Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Homemade Macaroni And Cheese Recipe, first place a saucepan on the heat.
1. Warm the milk over medium heat until it starts to bubble.
1. Do not let it come to a rolling or vigorous boil, and take it off the heat before.
1. In a separate heavy bottomed pot melt the butter over medium heat.
1. Add the flour and whisk constantly until the mixture turns light brown.
1. This will take 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Take it off the heat.
1. Next, slowly pour the warm milk little by little into the butter flour mixture, while whisking constantly.
1. The mixture will get thinner, but keep whisking.
1. Once all the milk is added and whisked well, set the pot back over medium high heat and continue to whisk.
1. It will take about 2 to 3 minutes for the sauce to come together and become silky and thick.
1. At this stage, add salt and stir once more.
1. Meanwhile cook the pasta in salted boiling water, according to packet instructions.
1. Drain and rinse the pasta.
1. Add the cheddar cheese to the prepared sauce and cook over medium heat, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted.
