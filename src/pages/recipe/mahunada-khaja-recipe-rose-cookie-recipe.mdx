1. To begin making Mahunada Khaja Recipe (Andhra Style Gulabi Puvvulu), take all dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and add milk little by little.
1. Using a whisk, mix this well till combined.

1. And put inside the batter.
1. Here is the tricky part, just fill the mould to half so that the batter does not stick to upper most part of the mould.
1. Any batter sticking to the upper part of the mould results in being unable to unmold the cookies.
1. Now dip the mould into the kadai immediately.
1. Immerse it in hot oil for some time.
1. When it changes colour and is about half done, take the saut√© stick and just scrape the mould to remove the Mahunada Khaja.
1. This stage ensures that the Mahunada Khaja does not loose its shape.
1. After about a minutes, remove from hot oil.
1. Remember that it will further crisp up when cooling.
1. Repeat the same process till the batter is completed.
1. After unmolding the mahunada khaja,again dip the mould in hot oil and the dip in batter.
1. Within a few fried Mahunada Khaja are done, you will know how to maximise the frying.
1. You can dip the mould again in batter and fry, such that you will cover 3 cookies in the time that it takes to do 2 otherwise.
