### Instructions

1. To begin making Onion Rava Dosa, in a tadka pan heat a teaspoon of  oil.
1. Add cumin seeds and let it sizzle.
1. Turn off the heat and add grated coconut and roast for a few minutes in the existing heat.
1. In a medium bowl add rava, rice flour, all purpose flour, green chillies, peppercorns, chopped onions, torn curry leaves, coriander leaves, roasted cumin and coconut with required salt, stir well.
1. Add the buttermilk little by little and keep stirring until well combined.
1. The dosa batter should be watery.
1. Allow the rava dosa batter to rest for 15 minutes.
1. It will thicken a bit in the process, if it does, add just a little more water to make it a runny dosa batter.
1. Preheat a non stick dosa tawa on medium heat.
1. Sprinkle water on the tawa and if it sizzles it's perfectly hot for making the onion rava dosa.
1. Now pour a ladleful of batter from the border to inside of the tawa, the batter will sizzle and spread on its own.
1. The Rava Dosa is not spread like a traditional batter but is made to spread on its own.
1. Hence it's crucial for the batter to be runny.
1. Drizzle some oil around the Onion Rava Dosa and allow the dosa to cook on medium heat until brown and crispy from the bottom.
1. Onion Rava dosa needs to be cooked on one side, so fold and serve once it's ready.
1. Serve the Onion Rava Dosa along with Coconut Chutney and South Indian Filter Coffee  for a complete meal.
