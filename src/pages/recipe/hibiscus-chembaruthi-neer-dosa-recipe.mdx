### Instructions

1. To begin making the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa Recipe, first soak the rice over night or for at least 8 hours in water.
1. Once soaked, using a mixer grinder blend the rice along with the hibiscus leaves to form a smooth dosa batter.
1. The batter should be of smooth flowing consistency so we can pour it in the tawa and swirl it to spread.
1. This will not be spread like a regular dosaAdd salt and pepper to taste.
1. You can also optionally grind it along with green chillies.
1. The Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa is now ready to be made.
1. The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.
1. To make the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa, we don’t spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa.
1. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.
1. Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.
1. To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan.
1. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot.
1. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.
1. Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges.
1. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself.
1. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes.
1. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa.
1. The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked.
1. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.
1. Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle.
1. Place the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Neer Dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosa’s the similar way.
1. Make sure you place the Hibiscus Neer Dosa away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other.
1. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.
1. Serve the Hibiscus (Chembaruthi) Dosai along with Thenga Thogayal and a glass of Chickoo Banana Date Smoothie for a wholesome breakfast.
