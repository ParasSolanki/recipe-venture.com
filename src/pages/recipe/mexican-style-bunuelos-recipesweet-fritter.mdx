1. Add a small amount of the dough to check if the oil is hot enough, if the dough starts rising up then the oil is hot.
1. You can add the shaped dough one by one into the hot oil and start frying them till you get an even light brown color.
1. Take them out and place it over a paper napkin to drain some oil.
1.  Once it cools down add the caster sugar and cinnamon powder and coat them well and serve.
