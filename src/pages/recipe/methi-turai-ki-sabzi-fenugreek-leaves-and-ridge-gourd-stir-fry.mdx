### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1 Onion - finely sliced.
- 1/2 Lemon - juiced.
- 2 Dry Red Chillies - broken into halves.
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- 1/2 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- 2 Green Chillies - coarsely crushed.
- 2 cups Methi Leaves (Fenugreek Leaves) - roughly chopped.
- 500 grams Ridge Gourd (Turai/ Peerkangai) - cut into 1 inch cubes.
- 4 cloves Garlic - coarsely crushed.
- 2 tablespoons Sunflower Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Methi Turai Ki Sabzi, warm the oil in a heavy bottom pan or kadhai.
1. Add the cumin seeds and broken red chilies to it and allow them to crackle.
1. Next, add the finely sliced onions and saute them until pink, soft, almost translucent.
1. Then, add coarsely crushed garlic, green chilies, turmeric powder and coriander powder and saute it all together for a minute or two.
1. To this, add the cubed ridge gourd and toss on high heat for 3-4 minutes.
1. The ridge gourd will release water, cover and cook for 3-4 minutes more on medium heat, till it is soft and cooked through.
1. When done, uncover the kadhai, add the methi leaves, garam masala powder, lemon juice, salt and mix well once again.
1. Cook this together for 3-4 minutes again on a high heat until all the water released by methi and ridge gourd dries up.
1. At this stage, leave the sabzi uncovered, so that the vegetables can dry up completely leaving you with a dry sabzi.
1. Check the salt and spices in the end and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Turn off the heat, transfer to a serving bowl and serve warm.
1. Serve Methi Turai Ki Sabzi along with hot salad for a quick lunch or a weeknight dinner.
