### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Lemon juice.
- 1 tablespoon Milk.
- 1 liter Milk.
- 1/2 cup Sugar - powdered.
- Saffron strands - A pinch.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 300 grams Chenna (Homemade Cottage Cheese).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kaacha Gola recipe, we will firstly make fresh paneer.
1. For making paneer at home, you need to boil 1 litre milk in a saucepan and add 2 lemon juice and simmer the gas and boil for another few minutes till the milk clutters and the chenna gets separated from the whey.
1. Strain the whey by passing it through a fine muslin cloth.
1. Collect the chenna and hang the muslin cloth for few minutes so that the whey strains off completely.
1. Mash the paneer well with the help of your hands.
1. Break all lumps to make it as smooth as possible.
1. You can use store brought paneer only if it is fresh, but I prefer using home made paneer for making Kaacha Gola.
1. Once the paneer is smooth enough, add cardamom powder, soaked saffron and powdered sugar.
1. Mix everything well to make a soft and smooth dough.
1. Take a tray and arrange mini muffin paper liners on it.
1. Pinch a lemon sized ball from the paneer mix and roll it between your palm to make a smooth ball.
1. Place the ball on the paper liner and similarly make more.
1. Your Kaacha Gola is ready and would taste great if you refrigerate it for minimum 1 hour before serving.
1. Kaacha Gola is often served as a dessert during special occasions like marriages, festivals etc.
