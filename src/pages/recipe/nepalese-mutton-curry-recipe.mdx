### Instructions

1. To begin making the Nepalese Mutton Curry recipe, in a pressure cooker, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and add cloves, green cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves and then fenugreek seeds.
1. Fry them for around 15-20 seconds in medium heat until aroma starts to develop.
1. Add finely chopped red onion and fry until it becomes soft and starts changing color.
1. Add ginger and garlic paste and turmeric powder and fry further for around a minute.
1. Add chopped mutton and cook it for around 5-6 minutes with occasional stirring.
1. By now the meat starts to become brown.
1. Add the required salt, meat masala and red chili powder.
1. Cook it for around 2 minutes with occasional stirring and add diced tomato.
1. Cook it further for around 4-5 minutes until the diced tomato becomes soft and dissolved in the curry, and oil starts to separate from the masala.
1. Add garam masala, stir it and add a cup of water.
1. Put the lid of the pressure cooker and cook it for around 15 minutes (around 4 whistle) in low heat (if you are not using the pressure, cook the curry for around 25-30 minutes in low heat with lid on).
1.  Turn off the heat and let the cooker cools down until the steam in the pressure cooker releases completely.
1. It will take around 5-10 minutes depending upon the surrounding temperature.
1. Take the lid off, add a tbs of butter or ghee and give it a stir.
1. If you want to make more gravy or soup, add more water and bring it to boil in low heat.
1. Garnish with fresh coriander before serving.
1. Serve Nepalese Mutton Curry with Steamed Rice or Jeera Rice for a weekend night dinner.
