### Instructions

1. To begin making Murgh Palak Recipe, we have to first marinate the chicken, In a bowl, add curd, chicken pieces, mix well and keep it aside for at least 30 minutes.
1. Add the cleaned palak leaves to a pressure cooker with a teaspoon of water and salt.
1. Pressure cook for 1 whistle and release the pressure immediately by running the pressure cooker under tap water.
1. Remove the lid of the pressure cooker so that the cooking process stops.
1. Do not drain the water.
1. To make the palak puree, add the cooked palak along with ginger, garlic, green chillies and make a smooth Palak Puree for the Murgh Palak.

1. In a kadai, add 1 tablespoon of oil.
1. Once the oil is warm, add bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon and saute for a minute or two.

1. This will take 3 to 5 minutes.

1. When the water starts boiling, reduce the heat and close the lid of the pan.
