- 1 cup Gram flour (besan).
- 1/2 teaspoon Ajwain (Carom seeds).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vegan Chickpea Omelette Recipe, first place a non-stick griddle/tava on the heat.
1. Turn the heat to low so it can slowly pre-heat while you prepare the batter.
1. To make the batter, sieve the chickpea flour/besan into a mixing bowl to remove all lumps.
1. To it, add the ginger-garlic paste, ajwain, asafoetida, turmeric powder, baking soda, onion, tomato, green chillies, Coriander leaves and salt.
1. Mix well to combine.
1. Next, stir in the coconut milk (or Soy or Almond milk), if using, and mix to make a smooth batter.
1. Alternatively, add enough water to make a batter which is smooth and spreadable, but not too watery/runny.
1. When the griddle is hot enough, pour a ladle full of the batter on it and spread evenly into a round pancake.
1. Drizzle oil along the edges of the omelette and cook for 2-3 minutes, on medium heat till the bottom is golden brown.
1. Lift it gently with a spatula to check if it releases and if that bottom has cooked.
1. When it looks golden, flip the omelette over and cook on the other side for 1-2 minutes.
1. Serve hot along with Peanut Carrot Chutney.
