### Instructions

1. To begin making the homemade baked beans recipe, we first have to soak the beans overnight for about 8 hours in water.
1. We also have to make the cooked tomato puree.

1. Once the beans are soaked well, our next step is to cook them.
1. I like using the pressure cooker method to cook the beans.
1. Place the beans in the pressure, place the weight on, cover the pan and cook it along with 2-1/2 cups of water.
1. After you heat 4 to 5 whistles, turn the heat to low and cook for another 15 minutes.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure cooker to release its pressure naturally.
1. This would take another 10 minutes.
1. The beans continue to cook under the pressure even when it is turned off.
1. Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and drain out the excess liquids.
1. You store this liquid and use it in the vegetable stock or risotto.
1. Once the beans are cooked, our next step is to spice it up to make the baked beans.
1. Heat oil in a sauce pan on medium heat; add in the onions and garlic and give it a light saut√© until the onions are tender.
1. Add the tomatoes, honey and the spices and give it a stir.
1. Add in the cooked drained beans into the tomato gravy.
1. Stir fry the beans until the beans get well coated with the tomatoes.
1. Cover the pan, turn the heat to low and simmer the beans for about 30 minutes until you noticed the beans are well coated with the spices and tomatoes.
1. Check the salt and seasoning levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. You can optionally garnish the Homemade Baked Beans with coriander leaves and serve it along with toast, or Potato Cakes Recipe.
