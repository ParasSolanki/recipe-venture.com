### Instructions

1. To begin with Panchratan Dal Paniyaram Recipe, soak Millet and the Panchratan dal mix in the water for almost 3 hours separately.
1. After 3 hours, drain the water completely and combine the millet and dal mixture.
1. Now blend the mixture with ginger, green chilies, mint and curry leaves in a mixer to get a smooth batter.
1. Add a little water to the mixture to get the smooth batter.
1. Transfer the batter to a mixing bowl and add chopped onions, asafoetida and salt and mix it well.
1. Add the required water to the batter to make it of thick consistency just similar to idli batter.
1. The batter is now ready to make Panchratan Dal Adai Paniyaram.
1. The next step is to heat the Paniyaram pan on low-medium flame.
1. Pour 1 teaspoon oil into each cavities of the pan and put 1 tablespoon of batter into each of the cavities.
1. Once the caves are filled half, close the pan with a lid and cook on low-medium flame for 2-3 minutes.
1. After 2 or 3 minutes, open the lid and turn over each Paniyaram to allow it to cook on the other side too.
1. Once each Paniyaram is cooked, remove it from the pan and pour another batch of batter.
1. Serve the Panchratan Dal Paniyaram with South Indian Coconut Chutney or Green Coriander and Coconut Chutney.
