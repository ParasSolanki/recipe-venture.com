### Ingredients

- 300 grams Raw papaya - cleaned and chopped finely.
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- 300 grams Sugar.
- 1/4 teaspoon Saffron strands.

1. Blanch the papaya in boiling water for 3 minutes, switch off heat and let the pieces soak for another 5 minutes.
1. Drain the chopped papayas after soaking.
1. Dissolve sugar in 2 cups of water and stir on medium heat until sugar dissolves completely.

1. Now cook until sugar syrup gets to one thread consistency, and until sugar syrup become viscous and papaya pieces are cooked completely.
1. Turn off heat and add 1 tsp of vanilla essence in syrup.
1. Add saffron for natural color.
1. You can also add food color if you want.
1. Divide the mixture, put in separate bowls to add various colors.
1. Let these papaya pieces absorb the color and sugar syrup for next 16-24 hours.
1. Cover and keep aside.
1. Toss for every few hours for the color to be even.
1. After the soaking time, take out the papayas and place them on a wire net placed on top of a plate.

1. This process speeds up under the sun.
