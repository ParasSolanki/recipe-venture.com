### Ingredients

- 1 cup Red Chilli powder.
- 1/4 cup Mustard seeds - coarsely pounded.
- 250 gram Mango (Raw) - (baby mangoes).
- 1 cup Rock Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vadu Mangai Pickle Recipe, start with trimming the mango stem.
1. Next clean and wash mangoes with the water to remove any dirt particles.
1. On a large muslin cloth, spread them out evenly and allow them to dry or you can wipe them with the kitchen towel.
1. Prepare a large size jar with the lid by cleaning and washing it.
1. Once washed wipe the jar with a dry kitchen towel so that no traces of moisture or dirt remain inside the jar.
1. Set aside till required.
1. Next add the mangoes in a large steel mixing bowl along with salt, red chili powder and mustard powder.
1. Stir to combine.
1. Once mangoes are nicely coated with the spices, transfer to the prepared jar and seal the jar with the lid.
1. The pickling process takes about 10 days to 2 weeks.
1. Do not open the jar or use a spoon to stir the mangoes at this point.
1. Shake the jar gently once every day just enough to combine the Vadu Mangai Pickle ingredients.
1. After few days open the lid, you will notice that water is released from the Vadu Mangai Pickle.
1. The mangoes would have reduced in size a bit and will have wrinkle skin.
1. The wrinkled mango skin is the green signal that the Vadu Mangai Pickle is ready to consume.
1. The salt, chilli powder and the mustard will come together to form a gravy or what we call manga thanni.
1. Vadu Mangai Pickle is now ready to be savoured with curd rice for the lunch.
