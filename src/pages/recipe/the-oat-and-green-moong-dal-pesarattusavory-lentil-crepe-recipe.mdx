### Ingredients

- 50 grams Instant Oats (Oatmeal).
- 100 grams Cabbage (Patta Gobi/ Muttaikose) - finely chopped.
- Sunflower Oil - for cooking.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 inch Ginger - grated.

- 50 grams Green Moong Dal (Whole).
- Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - small bunch.
- 1/2 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Oats Pesarattu Recipe, we will first soak the rice, moong dal together in water for at least 3 hours.
1.  After 3 hours drain the water.
1. Blend the dal, rice, green chillies and ginger adding little water at a time to make a smooth thick batter.
1. Transfer the batter into a large bowl, add in the oats, salt, asafoetida, chopped cabbage and coriander leaves.
1. Stir well to combine the oats Pesarattu batter well.
1. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Our next step is to make the Pesarattu.
1. You will need a well-seasoned skillet.
1. Preheat the skillet on medium heat; sprinkle some water to check on the pan; if it sizzles then you know the pan has the right amount of heat to spread the Pesarattu batter.
1. Pour a ladle full of the Oats Pesarattu batter onto the pan and spread evenly inside out to make a circle.
1. Drizzle some oil on the top and the sides of the Pesarattu and allow it to cook on low to medium heat.
1. Once you notice the top of the Pesarattu getting steamed, flip it over to cook on the other side.
1. Once you notice brown spots and the Pesarattu is cooked, remove from the pan and serve hot.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining Pesarattu batter.
1. Serve the Oats Pesarattu along with jaggery and butter or along with Tomato Onion Chutney and Butter Milk.
