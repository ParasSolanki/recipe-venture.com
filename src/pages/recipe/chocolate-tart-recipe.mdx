- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 300 grams Dark chocolate - chopped (I used bournville).
- 3/4 cup Butter (unsalted) - cold and cut into pea size pieces.
- 1/2 cup Milk.
- 2 tablespoons Sugar.
- 2 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida) - plus more for dusting.

- 2 tablespoons Water - temperature to be at ice cold plus more if needed.
- 1 cup Heavy whipping cream - (I used amul cream in india).

### Instructions

1. We begin making the Chocolate Tart Recipe by following the below procedures:Method for making the tart crustIn a large mixing bowl; combine the flour, sugar, and salt.
1. Add the butter and mix the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
1. Add in a tablespoon of ice water at a time and knead to bring the flour together.
1. Knead to form a firm dough that is firm and does not break apart when you try to press it.
1. Make sure you only add a tablespoon of water at a time, as the warmth of your hand will help bring the flour together to form a dough.
1. Wrap the pastry crust dough in cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
1. After 30 minutes, roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface.
1. Roll it out to make a circle of 12 inch diameter that is about 1/4 inch thick.
1. Lift the dough carefully from the floured surface and place it in a 9 inch tart pan with a removable base.
1. Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan.
1. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the pan's ring.
1. Remove the excess dough that is hanging off the sides of the pan.
1. Place the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes.
1. This process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.
1. Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C.
1. Once the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven.
1. Cover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes.
1. The tart will look golden brown but not completely baked.
1. Remove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.
1. Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.
1. Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully.
1. Keep aside.
1. To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through.
1. Turn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat.
1. Add in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.
1. Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined.
1. The chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.
1. Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy.
1. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.
1. Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven.
1. It is important to monitor so you don't over bake the chocolate.
1. Remove the Chocolate Tart from the oven, and allow it to cool completely.
1. Refrigerate the Chocolate Tart for about 8 hours until set and serve it along with fresh fruits, like strawberries.
1. Serve the Chocolate Tart Recipe as a Dessert for a Get together Party to amuse your guest.
