### Instructions

1. To begin making the Drunken Noodles Recipe, we will first boil the flat noodles.
1. Heat a saucepan with 2 cups of water, a pinch of salt and a few drops of oil, on high heat.
1. Once the oil comes to a rolling boil, reduce the flame to medium-high and add the flat noodles into it.
1. Allow it to cook for a couple of minutes, just about about soft, ensuring it does not get over cooked.
1. Turn off the flame and drain off the excess water using a colander.
1. Hold the colander under running water to cut off the heat and stop the cooking process of the noodlesOnce the water is completely drained off, transfer the rice noodles to a bowl, grease your hands with cooking oil and run it through the noodles, to avoid the noodles sticking to each other.
1. To make Drunken noodle sauce In a mixing bowl, combine the brown sugar, honey, soy sauce, fish sauce and sriracha sauce.
1. To this add a tablespoon of hot water, mix well and set aside.
1. Getting ahead with Drunken Noodles Recipe; heat a wok with oil on medium flame, once the oil is hot add in the ginger and garlic and saute for about 30 seconds.
1. Into the wok add the onions and cook for about a minutes.
1. To the onions, add the red, green and yellow bell peppers along with the baby corn and stir fry on high heat until the vegetables are cooked, yet are crunchy when we bite into them.
1. At this stage add in the salt and the boiled rice noodles, and give the Drunken Noodles a good mix.
1. Finally add in the the Drunken noodle sauce and toss well for 3 to 4 minutes on high heat.
1. Turn off the flame and transfer the Drunken Noodles to a serving bowl and serve hot.
