1. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .
1. The rice batter can e a little coarser, but the urad dal batter has to be super smooth.
1. Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments.
1. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.
1. Hence you should place the batter in a large container.
1. Meanwhile blend spinach leaves and coriander in a mixer grinder to make a fine paste and keep aside.
1. Once the batter has doubled its volume, stir vigorously with a ladle and adjust salt according to the taste.
1. Now add the spinach and coriander paste and mix so that everything incorporates well.
1. Add water to adjust the consistency of the batter as it should be of thick flowing consistency and not runny.
1. Heat a skillet/dosa tawa and add few drops of oil.
1. Grease the tawa with little oil.
1. Take a scoop of batter and drop in the center of the tawa.
1. Spread it evenly in outward circular motion.
1. Add few drops of oil from the sides and in the center as well.
