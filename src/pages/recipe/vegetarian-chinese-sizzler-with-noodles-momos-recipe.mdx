### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vegetarian Chinese Sizzler With Noodles & Momos Recipe, we will make all the individual dishes first and keep them ready.
1. Follow Cabbage Kimchi Recipe to make the Kimchi to be served at the side.
1. Kimchi takes a day or two to ferment and get maximum flavour and benefits so you can make it ahead and store it in the fridge.
1. Cook the green beans in the pressure cooker along with 2 tablespoons water and a pinch of salt to taste.
1. After two whistles turn off the heat and release the pressure immediately to get green cooked beans and keep them aside.
1. Follow How to Cook Vegetables in a Pressure Cooker.
1. *To make the Veg Hakka Noodles:First cook the noodles according the instructions in the package.
1. Into hot boiling water, break the noodles into the water and allow it to soften and cook.
1. This will take about 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Once the noodles have softened, turn off the heat and drain the water.
1. Cool the noodles immediately by running it under cold water.
1. This stops the cooking process and prevents the noodles from getting too soft and soggy.
1. Add a tablespoon of oil to the cooled noodles to prevent sticking and keep aside.
1. Now we will heat oil in a large frying pan on high heat and once the oil is hot add sliced onions and ginger and saute until the onions have softened.
1. Once done add the capsicum, carrots, beans, cabbage,  spring onions, salt to taste and pepper powder and saut√© on high until it has a cooked and crisp texture.
1. Stirring on high heat cooks the vegetables faster and also helps it retain color and a subtle crispness.
1. You can even cover the vegetables and cook the vegetables for three minutes.
1. Once the vegetables are cooked yet firm stir in the soy sauce, chilli sauce, and chilli vinegar and stir fry for two minutes.
1. Once done stir in the cooked noodles and mix well to combine.
1. Turn off the heat and transfer Vegetarian Hakka Noodles to a serving bowl.

1. * To make the Vegetable Momos:We will first knead the dough for the Vegetarian Momos cover.
1. Method to make the momo cover.
1. Add the flour into a large mixing bowl.
1. Add a little water at a time and knead to make a smooth dough.
1. Once the dough comes together, keep kneading for about 5 minutes to make it smooth and elastic.
1. The dough should not be sticky.
1. Cover the dough and keep it aside for half an hour.
1. Method to make the filling for the momo You can use a turbo chop to chop all your vegetables individually or you can even finely chop them up.

1. Mix well to combine.
1. Our next step is to fill and shape the momosDivide the dough into small lemon size portions.
1. Keep the dough covered with a muslin cloth.
1. Dust the dough in flour and roll out into a circle of 2 to 3 inch diameter.
1. Do not roll too thick, as the filling will push itself out and tear when steamed.
1. Place a small spoon of filling in the centre of the rolled circle.
1. Wet the edges with little water to help seal the momos.
1. Bring together the edges of the dough with a pinching and folding motion on one side and bring the other side to hold to the pinched side.
1. By doing this, the half moon shaped momos will have a frilled look.
1. Proceed the similar way with the remaining dough.
1. You can experiment with different shapes and sizes that you like.
1. All it takes is some time and practice.
1. As you keep shaping the momos, you need to keep them on a greased platter and cover with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out.
1. While you are shaping the momos, keep a steamer with water boiling.
1. Grease the steamer pan with some oil to prevent the momos from sticking.
1. Place the shaped vegetarian momos on the greased steamer pan.
1. So when you have one set of shaped momos, place them in the steamer and steam on high for 5 to 7 minutes until you see a glaze on the skin.
1. The skin will begin to shine.
1. As soon as you notice this, turn off the heat.
1. Transfer the Vegetarian Momos from the steamer into a serving platter and keep aside.
