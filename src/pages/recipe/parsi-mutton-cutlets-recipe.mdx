### Instructions

1. To begin making the Parsi Mutton Cutlets Recipe, remove the moisture from minced mutton by pressing it between your palms.
1. Add the mutton mince to the mixing bowl.
1. Add all other ingredients except for oil and bread crumbs into the bowl including ginger, garlic, onion, coriander leaves, mint leaves, green chillies, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, potato, salt, cloves and cinnamon stick.
1. Mix well.
1. Take lemon sized ball of mutton mix and roll it well.
1. Now gently flatten it to form a disc.
1. Do this step for rest of the mutton mix.
1. Coat the cutlet with bread crumbs and keep aside.
1. Heat oil in a shallow pan for shallow frying.
1. Once oil is hot, place a few cutlets on the pan and fry on medium-low heat until browned on all sides and mutton is fully cooked.
1. Do this on medium low heat as we want the mutton to get cooked through the inside too.
1. I coated my cutlets on bread and suji mix just to add some texture over the cutlet.
1. Once cooked, remove from pan and set it on kitchen paper.
1. Serve Parsi Mutton Cutlets Recipe along with Dhaniya Pudina Chutney, Date Tamarind Chutney or any other chutney of your choice and Pickled Onions.
