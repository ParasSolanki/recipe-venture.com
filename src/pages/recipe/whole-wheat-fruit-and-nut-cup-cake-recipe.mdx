1. Pre-heat your oven to 180 degree Celsius for about 10 minutes and leave it.
1. In another bowl, mix all the dry ingredients and keep it ready.
1.  Now carefully add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients little by little and fold them.
1. If you feel the batter is too thick you can add 1/2 a cup milk and add the nuts and fold them evenly.
1. Do not over work with the batter much.
1. Take your muffin tray and grease them with oil and sprinkle some flour and dust the pan out.
1. By using an ice cream scoop, drop in the batter into the muffin molds and bake it in the oven for about 35 minutes till you see a golden color.
1. If you insert a skewer into the muffin, it should come out cleanly.
