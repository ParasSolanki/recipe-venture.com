### Instructions

1. To begin making Chocolate Honeycomb bun first add the milk, flour, butter, yeast, sugar, salt to a standalone mixer and mix for five minutes till all the ingredients are well combined.
1. You will get a soft and sticky dough.
1. Drizzle a little oil on the top, knead with your fingers for a few seconds.
1. The dough should be soft to touch.
1. Cover the bowl and allow the bread to proof for at least an hour until it is doubled in size.
1. Once the honeycomb dough has doubled in size, cut the dough in half and roll the dough into long strips of two inch thickness and then cut one inch pieces out of the strip.
1. You will get 28 pieces approximately.
1. Now take a piece and flatten it out a little in a circular shape and put some chocolate chip filling in the center, wrap the dough around the filling and pinch the dough in the center.
1. Shape into balls.
1. Do the same with the rest of the remaining dough.
1. Line a baking tray with baking paper and place the honeycomb dough balls in the shape of a Christmas tree.
1. If you like you can just place them in a round greased cake pan as well.
1. Cover the bread with a towel or another tray and keep them to rise again for an hour until the balls of dough have risen.
1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius for ten minutes.
1. Now glaze the honeycomb bread generously with softened or melted butter and bake for 15 minutes.
1. Make the honey glaze white the bread is in the oven.
1. In a small mixing bowl, combine the honey, softened butter, saffron strands and water.
1. Add all the ingredients listed.
1. Bring the glaze mixture to a boil and allow it to cool.
1. After the honeycomb buns has baked for 15 minutes remove and brush it with the honey glaze and bake again for another ten minutes till you get a nice brown crust at the top.
1. Remove the honeycomb buns and while the bread is still hot brush the rest of the honey glaze on top of it.
