### Instructions

1. To begin making the Zucchini Roll Up Lasagne Recipe, we will prep the zucchini, cut them vertically long to thin stripes.
1. Grill the zucchini over a grill pan, until you notice grill marks on either side.
1. Once you have finished grilling all the zucchini stripes, keep them aside to cool down.
1. To make the stuffing for the Zucchini Roll Up LasagneHeat a sauce pan with oil, add chopped garlic and saute till they soften.
1. Add in chopped onions and saute till the onions turn translucent.
1. Add in chopped zucchini and bell peppers and saute for another 5 minutes, sprinkle all the seasonings like thyme, rosemary and dried red chilli flakes and salt to taste.
1. Give it a toss and saut√© for another 2 minutes and turn off the heat and allow it to cool.
1. To make the Tomato Basil SauceBoil the tomatoes with required water in a saucepan.
1. Once you see the tomato skin peeling, turn off the heat.
1. When the skin peel off, then you know the tomatoes are ready.
1. Peel the skin off the tomatoes, remove the seeds of the tomato and roughly chop them.
1. Do keep all the juices the tomatoes release, this will add body to the tomato sauce.
1. Keep the chopped tomatoes aside.
1. In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
1. Add the chopped garlic and onions.
1. Stir for a few seconds until it begins to sizzle in the oil and the onions soften.
1. At this stage, add in the chopped tomatoes and the roughly chopped basil leaves, some salt, sugar, black pepper corns and stir to combine well.
1. We will now use a hand blender to coarsely puree the ingredients together to get a saucy texture.
1. Cover the pan with the lid slightly ajar and simmer the mixture for 20 to 30 minutes until the sauce is thick.
1. Keeping the lid slightly ajar helps to thicken the sauce by evaporating the excess water.
1. Add salt to taste, red chilli flakes for the punch and give it a stir.
1. Turn off the heat and set aside.
1. To Make the Zucchini Roll Up LasagnePreheat the oven to 180 degree celsius for 10 minutes.

1. Do the same for the rest of the zucchini sheets.
1. Take out a baking dish, pour the tomato basil sauce on to the tray and place Rolled Zucchini next to each other inside the tray.
1. Fill it up completely.
1. Top each zucchini roll with cheese and bake the Zucchini Roll Up Lasagne till the cheese melts.
