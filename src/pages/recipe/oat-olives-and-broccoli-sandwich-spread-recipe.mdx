### Instructions

1. To begin making the Oat Olives and Broccoli Sandwich Spread Recipe, we will first stir fry the broccoli in a wok or kadai.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a wok, add the broccoli and garlic, sprinkle some salt and sauté until the broccoli is cooked.
1. Once the broccoli is cooked, turn off the heat and allow it to cool.
1. Once cooled, add all the ingredients including broccoli garlic mixture, instant oats, pepper and spice oats, paneer, black olives, whole black peppercorns, cumin powder, walnuts, salt into a food processor and blend to make a smooth paste.
1. You will notice that the texture is coarse when you try to grind it very well.

1. Once ground well, check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. And that’s it, your Oat Olives and Broccoli Sandwich Spread is ready to be used on sandwiches, wraps, or even pastas.
