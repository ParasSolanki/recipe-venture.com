1. Combine the soaked and drained cashews in a mixer jar and grind into a smooth paste using a mixer grinder.

1. Once the butter has melted, add the cumin seeds and bay leaf, let the cumin seeds sizzle.
1. To this, add ginger-garlic paste, chopped onions and saute for 2-3 minutes, until the onions turn translucent and soft.
1. Once the tomatoes have softened, add the cumin powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder and mix well.
1. This will help the raw smell go away from the onions, ginger and garlic.
1. Stir the spices for a few seconds and then add in the tomato puree and cashew paste.
1. Saute for the Peshawari masala for about 5 minutes on medium heat until the gravy thickens and the tomato and cashews combine well along with the spices to form a creamy gravy.
1. When you add cashew nuts the gravy tends to thicken and hence you can adjust the consistency by adding 1/4 cup of water.
