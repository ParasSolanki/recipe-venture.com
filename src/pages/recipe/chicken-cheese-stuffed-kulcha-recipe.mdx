1. Bring the kulcha dough together to form a smooth dough with a few drops of cooking oil.
1. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and rest it in a warm place for about 30-40 minutes or until  the dough has doubled in size.

1. Next add all the dry masalas, red chilli powder, cumin powder, black pepper powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder and salt.
1. At this stage add the minced chicken and cook until the chicken has fully cooked through.
1. This will take a good 12-15 minutes.
1. The chicken will release some water of its own.
1. If the chicken is not cooked and the water has dried up completely then you can add a dash of water to help cook the chicken completely.
1. Once cooked, transfer to a bowl and allow it to cool.
1. Once the chicken mince has cooled, mix in the grated cheese.
1. To Cook the Chicken Cheese Stuffed KulchaPreheat the tawa on medium flame.
1. Remove the dough from the warm place, punch the dough back with your knuckles.

1. Now place a tablespoon or two of the chicken cheese filling in the center, and bring the edges of the chicken cheese kulcha together in the center.
1. Flatten the kulcha between your palms, dust in flour.
1. Roll them out to a slightly elongated shaped kulchas, now sprinkle a few drops of water and sprinkle a few coriander leaves and kalonji seeds.
1. Pat down gently with your fingers to help them stick on the kulchas.
1. Place the water side of the chicken cheese kulcha face down on the greased tawa which has been preheating.
1. Cook for about a minute before you flip and cook on the other side.
1. Slather butter generously on both sides of the Chicken Cheese Kulcha and flip and cook on both sides until the kulcha is golden brown and lightly crisp on both sides.
