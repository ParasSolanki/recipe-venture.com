### Instructions

1. To begin making the Asian Shrimp Rice Burger Recipe, we will first make the jasmine rice.
1. To make the Jasmine Rice  In a pressure cooker combine the jasmine rice, along with the water and oil and close the lid.
1. Pressure cook for two whistles and turn off the flame.
1. Once the pressure has released naturally, open the pressure cooker and spoon the rice into small bowls(katoris)  that are lightly greased with oil, this will help de-mould them like the shape of burger buns.
1. Fill each of the small bowls with only about two tablespoons and press them lightly and allow them to set for about 15 minutes.
1. Demould and set aside.
1. You should be left with semi circle shaped rice buns.
1. To make the Shrimp Patties In a mixing bowl, combine the freshly made shrimp paste with the chopped shrimps, salt,  black pepper powder, soy sauce, bread crumbs and bring the shrimp patty mixture together with the egg.
1. Mix until well combined.
1. Preheat a skillet brushed with oil on medium high heat.
1. Shape the shrimp patties into a small cake, like that of cutlets to the size of the rice buns we made earlier.
1. Now place the shrimp patties on the skillet and cook on both sides for about 2-3 minutes each as prawns cook very quickly.
1. Once they turn golden brown on each side, remove from the skillet and set aside.
1. To make the Asian Flavoured MayonnaiseIn a mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, along with the black pepper powder, sriracha sauce, salt, soy sauce and sesame oil.
1. Whisk well until combined and set aside.
1. To assemble the Asian Shrimp Rice Burger RecipePlace one semi circular rice bun on the working counter, slather some Asian flavoured mayonnaise, then place the lettuce leaves, the shrimp patties, onions rings and finally close the burger with another rice bun and sprinkle some black sesame seeds.
1. Repeat the same to assemble the other Asian Shrimp Rice Burgers.
1. Serve Asian Shrimp Rice Burger Recipe along with Spicy Sichuan (Szechuan) Vegetarian Noodles Recipe and Chinese Style Stir Fried Water Chestnut with Vegetables Recipe for a complete meal.
