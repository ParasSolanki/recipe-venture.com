### Instructions

1. To begin making the Green Spinach & Oats Cutlet Recipe, we will first get all the ingredients ready.
1. Heat a heavy bottomed pan and roast the oats for a few minutes, until you get a roasted aroma.
1. Once roasted, remove from the pan and keep it aside.
1. In the same pan, add the chopped spinach and saute it until the spinach wilts down and the excess moisture evaporates.
1. Once ready, remove the spinach from the heat and allow it to cool.
1. The next step is to make the cutlet mixture.
1. Add the roasted oats, the cooked spinach, green peas, green chillies, coriander, salt, pepper oregano and lemon juice into a food processor and combine to make a coarse mixture.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Divide the Green Spinach & Oats Cutlet mixture into 8-10 portions.
1. Grease your fingers with oil and flatten the cutlet mixture and shape them a little.
1. Grease and preheat a skillet on medium heat.
1. Place the Spinach & Oats Cutlet portions onto the skillet.
1. Drizzle a little oil and cook on both sides until lightly browned and crisp.
