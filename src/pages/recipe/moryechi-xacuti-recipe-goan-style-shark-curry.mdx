### Instructions

1. To prepare Moryechi Xacuti / Shark Curry recipe, wash shark pieces well with water, drain and marinate with the ingredients mentioned for marination.
1. Keep aside for about 20 minutes.
1. Heat a Skillet, add oil and fry all the spices mentioned under whole spices on medium high heat for 2-3 minutes and remove out on a plate.
1. On the same skillet, fry sliced onions and garlic on medium high until onions turn translucent.
1. This will take about 5 minutes.
1. Now, add grated coconut and saute till coconut changes color to light brown.
1. That is about 6-7 minutes.
1. Switch off the heat.
1. Add a teaspoon turmeric powder, mix well and remove from heat.
1. Allow the mixture to cool down for some time.
1. Grind the roasted spices along with fried coconut onions and tamarind using a cup of water to smooth paste.
1. Take the paste in a saucepan kept on medium high heat and allow it to boil.
1. Add salt and red chili powder.
1. Mix well and add marinated fish.
1. Mix, cover and let the fish cook on medium high heat until done.
1. Check in between if the fish is cooked.
1. Use toothpick to check.
1. The toothpick should be able to poke easily in the fish, once it is ready.
1. Sometimes shark gets cooked very quickly, but for me it took 25 minutes total to cook the fish.
1. Once the gravy is all ready, add chopped coriander leaves, mix well and simmer on low heat for 5 more minutes and remove from heat.
1. Enjoy Moryechi Xacuti / Shark Curry recipe with hot steamy rice.
