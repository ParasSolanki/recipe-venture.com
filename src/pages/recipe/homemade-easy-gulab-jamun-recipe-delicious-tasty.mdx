### Ingredients

- Sunflower Oil - for deep frying.
- 1/4 teaspoon Saffron strands.
- 600 ml Water.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 120 grams All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 400 grams Sugar.
- 200 ml Fresh cream.
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.
- 2 tablespoons Rose water.
- 1/4 teaspoon Baking soda.
- 250 grams Milk Powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Gulab Jamun Recipe, get all the ingredients ready.
1. Preheat the oil for deep frying.
1. Into a large mixing bowl, add all the dry ingredients - milk powder, maida, sugar, soda and cardamom powder.
1. Add the cream and mix well to combine until you get a dough like consistency.
1. The Gulab Jamun mixture will be a little sticky and this is the nature of it, as the milk powder has sweet which will cause this.
1. Grease your fingers with oil and start shaping the Gulab Jamuns into tiny balls little larger than an Indian gooseberry / amla.
1. Once you have shaped all the Gulab Jamun dough, we will now begin to start deep frying.
1. Slide the Gulab Jamuns into the pre heated oil and deep fry on medium heat until all the jamuns are fried until golden brown.
1. It will take close to 5 minutes to fry a batch of jamuns over medium heat.
1. Once fried strain them into kitchen paper towels and keep aside.
1. Parallely, into a large wide bowl heat the water and sugar.
1. Allow the sugar to dissolve completely.
1. Once the sugar dissolves, add the rose water and a large pinch of saffron.
1. Give the Gulab Jal water a brisk boil for about 2 to 3 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Add the fried Gulab Jamuns into the hot gulab jal water and allow it to soak for about 2 hours.
1. The Gulab Jamuns will expand and soak in the water and fluff up.
1. So ensure you keep some room in the gulab jal water bowl for this expansion.
1.  If required soak it in two bowls.
1. Cover the pan while the gulab jamun us soaking so it becomes soft.
1. Half way through the soaking process, turn the Gulab Jamuns around so all the sides get evenly soaked.
1. Once soaked, the Gulab Jamuns are ready to be served.
1. Serve the Gulab Jamuns hot or cold as a dessert after a delicious meal.
