1. Baking the Black Forest cake recipe takes separate time for cooking a chocolate cake, making chocolate trees, frosting and assembling.
1. Instruction for Chocolate cakeSift flour, baking powder and cocoa powder in a large and dry mixing bowl.
1. Keep aside.
1. In a separate mixing bowl, add sugar and butter and blend it with an electric blender till sugar dissolves.
1. Add one egg at a time and keep blending till it's smooth and creamy.
1. Now pour in some vanilla extract and give a quick mix again.
1. Take the dry ingredient mix and start adding into the wet ingredient mix gradually.
1. Add thick curd and fold in with a spatula to make a clean and smooth batter (Do not beat or whisk the batter).
1. Preheat the oven at 180 degree C for 10-15 minutes.
1. Meanwhile grease and dust a baking pan and pour in the batter.
1. Tap the cake pan on the counter to break and settle the air bubbles formed.
1. Place the pan inside the oven and bake it for 35-40 minutes or till the toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
1. Transfer the cake on a wire rack and allow it to cool down completely.
1. Once the cake is cool, carefully remove it from the pan and cling wrap it.
1. Keep the wrapped cake in a dry and cool place till you prepare the frosting.
1. Instruction for Chocolate TreesOn an A4 size sheet, draw the sketch of a tree measuring the correct height required according to the cake.
1. Take a butter paper of a little larger/equal size and fix it over the sketch with a tape.
1. Add melted chocolate in a piping bag and cut off the tip to make a small opening.
1. Now make chocolate tree stencil over the sketch.
1. Refrigerate the butter paper for almost an hour so that the tress become hard nicely.
1. Instruction for FrostingIn a large mixing bowl, take heavy cream/ whipping cream and add icing sugar to it.
1. With and electric blender whip the cream till soft peak appears.
1. Refrigerate the whipped cream for 10 mins.
1. Meanwhile take the chocolate cake prepared, remove the cling foil.
1. Take a sharp serrated knife and slice the cake horizontally into two half.
1. If you are skilled, you can make three slices too like I did.
1. Keep all the three slices separate.
1. In a bowl, add 4 tablespoons of icing sugar in half a cup of water and stir to make a sweet solution.
1. Brush the cake slices top with this sweet solution generously.
1. This will keep the cake moist from inside.
1. Now carefully place the first slice on the turntable.
1. Brush some cherry compote all over the top.
1. With a clean spatula spread some whipped cream over the compote and spread chopped cherries over it.
1. Place the second slice on top and repeat the same.
1. Now place the final third slice on it and press gently with your palm.
1. Now take whipped cream generously and apply all over the cake to cover it from top and sides.
1. Do this till you get a smooth finish.
1. Add some whipped cream in a disposable piping bag and make rosettes on the top border.
1. Sprinkle chocolate shavings inside the rosette circle and place some cherries and white chocolate chips all over.
1. Take out the chocolate tres from the fridge and place them on the sides by carefully pressing them with the cream to attach properly.
1. Sprinkle some chocolate chips on the bottom to cover the gap between the tree roots.
1. Refrigerate the cake for minimum 2 hours before serving.
