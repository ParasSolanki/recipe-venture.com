### Instructions

1. To begin making the Diwali Cornflakes Mixture Recipe, first get all the ingredients prepared and ready.
1. Our first step is to deep fry the Makai (corn) Flakes.
1. Preheat the oil for deep frying in a wide deep frying pan over medium heat.
1. Add a handful of Makai (corn) flakes at a time and deep fry them until golden, crisp and puffed up.
1. It takes just a few seconds to deep fry these flakes.
1. They are similar to papads.
1. Once you have deep fried the Makai (corn) flakes, drain them on kitchen paper towels and keep aside.
1. In the same oil, place the poha in a steel colander and deep fry the poha by dipping the colander in the oil.
1. Once you notice the poha has puffed up, immediately remove the poha from the oil.
1. Place them on kitchen paper towels to drain the excess oi.
1. Finally we will roast the nuts in the oil.
1. Place the nuts and peanuts in the same colander and deep fry them until golden brown and crisp.
1. Once done drain and keep aside.
1. Finally deep fry the curry leaves and raisins in hot oil placed in the colander.
1. Once crisp and raisins have puffed up, remove from oil and place on the paper towel to drain.
1. Place all the fried ingredients in a wide mixing bowl or a flat baking sheet.
1. Sprinkle the salt, red chili powder, sugar and asafoetida powder and stir to combine well with your hands.
1. Do this when all the ingredients are hot, so the spices and salts get well combined into them.
1. Check the spice and salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Once done, cool and store the Corn Flakes Mixture in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
1. Serve the Corn Flakes Mixture as a perfect evening snack or for festivals like Diwali along with a cup of Masala Chai.
