### Instructions

1. To begin making the Ajwain Besan Ka Paratha, we will first make the dough.
1. Add in the flour and a pinch of salt into a large bowl.
1. Add a little water at time and knead to make a firm yet smooth dough.
1. Knead well for about 3 to 4 minutes, this will make the parathas soft.
1. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil over the dough and knead for another couple of minutes.
1. Cover and keep aside.

1. Divide the dough into large lemon side balls.

1. Now add some besan, ajwain, salt, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, turmeric powder and coriander leaves on half side of the circle.
1. Mix everything properly and drizzle some oil on the mixture.
1. Close the paratha by folding it with the other half.
1. We will have a semi circle oval shape.
1. Press the sides of the paratha down to seal the edges and gently using the rolling pin to flatten it.
1. Take care, the filling can ooze out if the dough is rolled out too thin.
1. Now to cook the ajwain besan Paratha, first preheat the skillet on medium heat.
1. Place the rolled paratha on top and allow it to cook on one side.
1. After about 10 to 15 seconds, flip the paratha.
1. At this stage, smear some oil or ghee to cook the paratha.
1. Cook the paratha by flipping over a couple of times until you see golden brown spots on both sides.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining dough portions and serve the parathas hot.
