### Instructions

1. To begin making the Scrambled Paneer Sandwich Recipe, prep all the ingredients, grate paneer and finely chop onions, cashewnuts, ginger and green chilli (if you are using.
1. You can skip green chillies altogether if you are serving for kids who do not like spicy sandwich).
1. In a small frying pan, heat a bit of oil.
1. Once the oil is hot, add mustard seeds on a low medium heat, and allow them to splutter.
1. Once they splutter, add nigella seeds, green chilli and curry leaves.
1. Saute for a few seconds.
1. Add the chopped onion and ginger pieces, and on a medium heat, fry them by stirring occasionally until lightly browned.
1. Reduce the heat to low, add the grated coconut, paneer, turmeric, cashewnuts, salt and stir till the paneer is well fried and there is a delicious cooked smell from the sandwich filling.
1. Check on seasoning to adjust to your taste, you may add black pepper (freshly ground) to the mixture, stir well to combine and turn off heat.
1. Allow the filling to cool down a bit, if you want to accelerate cooling, you can transfer the sandwich filling paneer mixture to a plate, spread and place on the countertop for a faster cooling.
1. Meanwhile, on a flat skillet, place the diagonally cut breads and toast them on low heat until browning a bit.
1. Flip and toast further for about half a minute till the other side is also browned.
1. Either prepare the sandwich by smearing a good amount of scrambled paneer on the toasted breads, or pack the stuffing in a separate container for your kids for lunch.
