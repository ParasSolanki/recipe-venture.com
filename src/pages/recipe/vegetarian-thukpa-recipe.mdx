### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vegetarian Thukpa Recipe, first get all the ingredients ready for the soup.
1. Add the wheat flour, a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl.
1. Add little water at a time to make a firm and smooth dough.
1. Cover the dough and let it rest for 10 minutes.
1. Knead once again and divide the dough into 3 large portions.
1. Roll each portion into very thin rounds, tossing on flour to prevent it from sticking.
1. Cut the rolled portions into strips to make noodles and keep it aside.
1. The next step is to make the Thukpa in a single pot.
1. In a large saucepan, heat the mustard oil on medium heat.
1. Add the onions and garlic and saute until you can smell the aromas coming through and the onions are translucent.
1. Once the onions are translucent, add the chopped tomatoes and cook them on low to medium heat until they become soft and mushy.
1. Add the cumin powder, garam masala and pepper.
1. Give it a stir.
1. Add the chopped spinach and radish and saute for a couple of minutes until it gets combined into the masala.
1. Cover the pan and simmer for 2 to 4 minutes on low heat, until the radish and spinach get cooked through.
1. To this add 3 cups of water and bring the Thukpa to a brisk boil.
1. Once it comes to a brisk boil, add the cut wheat strips (paapes) into the boiling Thukpa.
1. Continue to boil the thukpa for 3 to 4 minutes.
1. You notice the wheat strips start rising to the top.
1. Finally add the salt and lemon juice to taste and give it a stir.
1. Turn off the heat.
1. Stir in the freshly chopped coriander leaves and serve it hot as a one dish meal for a quick weeknight dinner.
1. Serve the Vegetarian Thukpa Recipe hot along with Vegetarian Momo Recipe-Steamed Dumplings/A Street Food from the No for a relaxing Sunday Meal.
