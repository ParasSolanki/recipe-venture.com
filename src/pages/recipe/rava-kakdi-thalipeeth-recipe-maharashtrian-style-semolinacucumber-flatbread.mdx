1. Add water as required (about 2-3 tablespoon) to make a dough that just holds all the ingredients together.

1. Cover the bowl and keep the dough in it aside for 15-20 minutes to rest.
1. Add more water if required to make a pliable dough.
1. Divide the dough in 4-5 portions.
1. Grease a flat skillet with some ghee.
1. Place 1 portion of the dough on the greased pan and pat to make a thin circle (about 6 inches)With your finger make one hole in the centre of the patted dough and 4 more round it.
1. Drizzle few drops of ghee in these holes.
1. Place the pan on low heat.
1. Cover and cook till the underside turns brown.
1. Flip the Thalipeeth and cook for a minute or till done, on low heat.
1. Repeat this procedure with the rest of the dough portions, patting the thalipeeth directly on the skillet.
