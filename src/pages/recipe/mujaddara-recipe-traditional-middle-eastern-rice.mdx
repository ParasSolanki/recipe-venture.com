1. Add the rice and toss once again.
1. Add about 2-2 Â½ cups water or vegetable stock (use leftover liquid from cooking the lentils, if any).
1. Cook covered till the rice is just cooked, until the grains are soft to bite but grains remain separate and not mushy.
1. Take the rice out in a serving plate and garnish with the rest of the fried onions and pine nuts.
1. Drizzle lime juice, just before serving.
1. Serve Mujaddara along with Fattoush With Za'atar, Sumac and Pomegranate Molasses and spiced yogurt or Grilled Aubergines with Tzatziki for a weeknight dinner.
