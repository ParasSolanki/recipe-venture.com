### Ingredients

- 1 cup Heavy whipping cream.
- 1 cup Sugar - granulated.
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- 1/2 teaspoon Sea salt.
- 6 tablespoons Butter - room temperature.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Salted Caramel Sauce Recipe, heat a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Add the butter and sugar to it and keep on medium heat and stir.
1. Melt the sugar and butter together and allow the sugar to get a dark golden color.
1. This will take about 5 minutes.
1. Be careful not to burn the sugar.
1. Turn off the heat as soon as the sugar turns golden brown in color and starts to smoke and bubble.
1. Immediately stir in the heavy cream slowly stirring continuously at the same time.
1. Keep stirring until you get a smooth caramel.
1. Be careful when you add cream into the caramel as when you add cream the mixture will rapidly bubble and splutter as well.
1. Since the mixture bubbles up, use a little bigger pan to make the caramel sauce in.
1. Once done add in the vanilla extract, sea salt and stir well to combine.
1. Let the Salted Caramel Sauce cool and then transfer it to a jar and keep it in fridge in airtight jar.
1. Serve this delicious Salted Caramel Sauce Recipe on Carrot And Orange Loaf Cake and serve along with your coffee during your tea time break or simply serve it over a scoop of Apple Pie Ice Cream Recipe.
