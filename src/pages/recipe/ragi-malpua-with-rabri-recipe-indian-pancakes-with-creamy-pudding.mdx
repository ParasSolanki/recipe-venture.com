### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Ragi Flour (Finger Millet/ Nagli).
- 1 teaspoon Baking powder.
- 1/2 cup Sugar.
- 1/2 cup Water.
- 1/2 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- Ghee - for pan frying.
- Rabri - one recipe.
- Saffron strands - a few.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1/2 teaspoon Salt.
- 1/2 cup Fresh cream.
- 1 teaspoon Fennel seeds (Saunf) - pounded.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Ragi Malpua Rabri, combine all the ingredients for the Malpua batter - Ragi flour, whole wheat flour, fennel seeds, cardamom powder, baking powder, salt and fresh cream in a large mixing bowl.
1. Add water or milk to make a thick Malpua (pancake) batter.
1. Keep covered for about 10 minutes.
1. The next step is the make the sugar syrup for the Malpua.
1. In a saucepan, add the sugar, water and saffron on medium heat.
1. Keep stirring continuously until the sugar dissolves.
1. Once the sugar dissolves, turn the heat to low and simmer the sugar syrup until you get a one string consistency.
1. This just means that when you touch the sugar syrup it will feel sticky.
1. Once the syrup is done keep aside.
1. The next step is to make the Malpuas.
1. Traditionally the Malpuas are deep fried, but in this recipe, to preserve the nutrition, I am making them pan fried, similar to how we make the pancakes or Uttapam.
1. Preheat a skillet on medium heat; grease it with ghee.
1. Pour a ladle full of batter on the preheated skillet.
1. Drizzle a teaspoon of ghee around the edges of the Malpua and allow it to cook.
1. When you notice that that the raw batter on the top is getting cooked, flip the Malpua over to cook on the other side.
1. Once done remove from the pan and proceed to make the remaining Mapuas.
1. When cooked, dip the cooked Ragi Malpuas in the sugar syrup of a couple of seconds and take it out.
1. Place the sugar-coated Ragi Malpuas on a dessert platter, spoon some Rabri on the top, sprinkle some chopped nuts.
1. Serve the Ragi Malpuas Along With Rabri (Basundi) as a dessert when you have a party or even for festivals and special occasions along with Gulab Jamun and jalebis.
