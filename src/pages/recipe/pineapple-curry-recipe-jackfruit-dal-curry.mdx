### Instructions

1. To begin making the Panasa Pottu Pappu Koora Recipe, wash and soak the moong dal in water and set aside.
1. Next let us cut the raw jackfruit.
1. In order to do that we have to first, grease our hands and the knife that we are going to use, with some oil.
1. This important tip ensures that the hands don't get sticky from the natural fruit latex/sap present in the fruit does not get onto your hands and makes the cutting process hassle-free.
1. Keep a bowl of water mixed with some salt, ready to put the cut raw jackfruit pieces to avoid discolouration of the fruit.
1. Now that your hands and knife are well greased, cut the the jackfruit in half, discard the skin and start making 1 inch pieces and soak them in the salted water.
1. Place the jackfruit in a pressure cooker with 1/4 cup of water and pressure cook for 3 whistles and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.

1. For the tempering of the Panasa Pottu Pappu Koora Recipe , heat oil in a pan,on medium flame, add the split urad dal until it turns into a golden brown colour.
1. Next, add cumin seeds, mustard seeds and allow them to crackle.
1. This will take about 30 seconds.
1. Once they crackle, add the red chillies, asafoetida, curry leaves and fry till you get nice aroma.
1. Turn off the heat.
1. In a kadai, add the cooked and shredded jackfruit, moong dal and mix everything well.
