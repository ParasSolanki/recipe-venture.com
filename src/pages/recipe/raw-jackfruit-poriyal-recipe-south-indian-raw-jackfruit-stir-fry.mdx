1. Drain any water from the jackfruit and set aside.
1. In a frying pan, heat oil on medium heat, add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle, next add asafoetida, urad dal and chana dal and fry till they turn golden brown.
1. This will take about a minute.
1. Once they have turned brown, add in the curry leaves, green chilies, salt, turmeric powder, black pepper powder and the boiled raw jackfruit pieces.
