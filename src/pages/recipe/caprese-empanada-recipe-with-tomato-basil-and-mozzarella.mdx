### Instructions

1. Method For CrustSift flour with salt into a large bowl mixing bowl.
1. Add the dried herbs and mix well.
1. Add the cubes of butter to it and rub the butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
1. Next in another bowl, beat together egg and water in a small bowl with a fork.
1. Add this to the flour and butter mixture and stir with a fork until just mixed together.
1. Turn out mixture onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently with heel of your hand once or twice, just enough to bring dough together.
1. Do not overwork the dough in anyway.
1. It should just come together.
1. Press the dough into a flat rectangle and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour.
1. Method For the FillingChop the all the filling ingredients into tiny cubes, place it in a mixing bowl, add salt and paprika and stir it combine.
1. Give it a taste and add more salt (or spice if you like).
1. Keep the Caprese Filling aside.
1. For making the Caprese EmpanadasBring out the dough from the fridge and quickly start working.
1. Keep the counter clean and dusted with flour, a bowl with egg wash, a pastry brush, a cookie cutter, and plates with flour dusted on them handy.
1. Roll out the dough into a thin rectangle.
1. Using a cookie cutter, cut circular discs off the dough.
1. You can also use an empanada shaper to make these Caprese Empanadas.
1. Place a spoonful of the caprese filling towards the center and fold it into semi circle to form a half moon shape.
1. Working quickly pinch the edges together and make small pinches along the border or indent the edge with a fork.
1. Keep aside on the flour dusted plate till others are ready.
1. Remember to work quickly since you don't want the dough to get warm.
1. Once you have finished shaping and filling the caprese empanadas brush the crust with an egg wash on top if you wish.
1. Again place the filled and shaped empanadas in the fridge for 20 mins at least to chill.
1. This chilling process will help the empanadas get a good crust.
1. Preheat the oven at 180 C.
1. Dust the baking sheet with flour and place the chilled caprese empanadas on it.
1. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes till it has a golden crust on all sides.
