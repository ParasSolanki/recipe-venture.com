### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Ghee.
- 160 grams Palm jaggery - powdered.
- Water - as needed.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 3 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 2 tablespoons Ghee.
- 250 grams Fresh coconut - grated.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Thengai Poli Recipe first sieve the wheat flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl.
1. Add  water a little at a time to knead to make a soft dough.
1. Adding enough water is critical, so the dough is soft and pliable.
1. Add ghee and knead again.
1. Knead the dough well  to form a smooth dough.
1. Once done make a smooth ball of the dough, cover the bowl and keep aside for 2 hours.
1. In the meanwhile, prepare the sweet coconut filling.
1. To do this, first heat a pan and add 1 teaspoon ghee.
1. Next add the grated coconut, cardamom powder and palm jaggery to it.
1. Stir well on a low flame for 5-8 mins till all the moisture is absorbed and the coconut mix comes together with the jaggery.
1. Once the poli filling mixture has come together, turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool.
1. When it has cooled, divide it into equal sized portions and form balls the size of medium lemons.
1. Now, take the dough that’s been resting and divide it into equal sized portions.
1. Keeping a little flour for dusting handy on a plate; roll out the dough into 3 inch diameter circles.
1. Place a portion of the filling (puran) mixture into the center of the circle.
1. Bring edges of the circle towards the center and fold over to cover the entire filling; making sure the edges are all sealed well by pinching them together if there is any opening.
1. Flatten the stuffed poli; dust the dough in a little flour and roll gently into a 5 to 6 inch diameter circle taking care not to put too much pressure as the filling can come out of the dough.
1. The Thengai Poli should be thin and not thick.
1. Once done, we will proceed to cook the poli.
1. Preheat an iron skillet on medium high; place the rolled poli’s onto the skillet to cook until golden brown on both sides.
1. You can cook the poli's with ghee to give it a richer taste and flavor.
1. Repeat the above process for all the remaining dough and puran portions and serve hot.
1. You may store the Thengai Poli in an airtight container, in the refrigerator, once they have cooled.
1. They will keep well for a week at least.
1. However, if you are serving them on the same day, allow them to remain at room temperature.
1. Thengai Poli if refrigerated is served by bringing it back to room temperature, slightly warming them in the microwave and served with a dollop of homemade ghee.
1. Serve Thengai Poli for festivals such as Diwali, Navratri or even Janmashtami.
