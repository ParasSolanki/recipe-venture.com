- 1 Red Bell pepper (Capsicum) - diced.
- 1 pinch Salt.
- 1 Broccoli - cut into florets.
- 1 Onion - thinly sliced.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Whole Wheat Crepe Recipe With Herbed Vegetables, first get all the ingredients ready.
1. In a small mixing bowl, blend all the ingredients for the crepe along with just enough water to make the crepe batter light and fluffy.
1. The batter should coat the back of the spoon, but at the same time it should be runny and thin.
1. Then strain the crepe mixture through a fine mesh sieve.
1. Pouring the mix into a tall jug makes it easier to portion out the batter when making crepes on a hot pan.
1. Allow the crepe batter to rest at room temperature for about 15 to 20 minutes.
1. This makes the crepes soft and fluffy.
1. The next step is to toss the vegetables in a wok.
1. Heat a teaspoon of olive oil in a wok; add the broccoli, onion, bell pepper, sprinkle some salt and toss the vegetables on high heat for just 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Its nice when the vegetables are not over cooked, but are just stir fried to get a crunch in the crepe.
1. Once done, turn off the heat, check the salt and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Stir in the parsley and keep aside.
1. To begin making the crepes, warm a crepe pan with a rim on a medium heat.
1. Butter or oil it evenly.
1. When the pan gets hot, pour just enough batter to cover the base, and start tilting and swirling the pan to spread the batter and make a crepe.
1.  These crepes gets cooked really quick and you need to cook it just until the bottom begins to get a little golden, then gently lift the edges and flip the crepe to cook on the other side for a few seconds.
1. Transfer the prepared whole wheat crepes to a platter and cover with a dome lid to keep warm and soft.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining batter and stack the crepes one on top of the other.
1. Once the crepes are made, spread the cheese spread on the inside of the crepes, place the stir fried vegetables inside and fold into half and serve.
1. Serve Whole Wheat Crepe Recipe With Herbed Vegetables along with Cold Coffee Smoothie and Spinach and Feta Muffins for breakfast.
