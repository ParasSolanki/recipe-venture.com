### Instructions

1. To begin making the Palak Kala Chana Recipe first clean, wash and soak chickpeas in water overnight or at least 5 - 6 hours.
1. First make puree of tomato and green chili using 2 - 3 tablespoons of water in blender.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a pan; add in the chopped spinach and saute until the spinach is soft and tender.
1. Keep this aside.
1. Note: We cook the spinach separately from the chola, as the cooking times for the chickpeas and spinach are very different.
1. Spinach takes a couple of minutes, while the chola/ chickpeas take 20 to 30 minutes.
1. In a pressure cooker heat oil over medium heat, once oil is heated add in the bay leaf and cardamom pods; saute for 1 minute or until spices start releasing aroma.
1. Now add in chopped onion, ginger and garlic and saute over medium heat until onion turn light brown in color.
1. Once onion is ready add tomato puree, salt, turmeric powder, garam masala, and coriander powder, red chili powder until you see the mixture coming together and thickening a little bit.
1. Add the chickpeas along with the water it was soaked in into the masala and stir well.
1. Add in additional water so that the water level is atleast 2 inches above the soaked Kala Chana.
1. Give it a good stir and cover the pressure cooker and place its weight on.
1. Cook the kala Chana in the pressure cooker until you hear 4 to 5 whistles.
1. After 4 to 5 whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer the chana for another 15 minutes and then turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. This will take another 15 minutes.
1. Once the pressure releases naturally, open the cooker, add in the sauteed spinach and give it a good stir.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Gently mash the chickpeas little bit with the back of the ladle to thicken the gravy little bit and the Palak Kala Chana Sukhi Recipe is ready to be served.
1. Serve the Palak & Kala Chana Sukhi Sabzi Recipe along with Dal Tadka, Dill Cucumber Raita, Jeera Rice and Phulka for a delicious weekday meal.
