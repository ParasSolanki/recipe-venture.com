### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kerala Style Avial Recipe, we will first steam all the vegetables along with salt.
1. I like to cook the vegetables together in a pressure cooker.
1. To do this, place all the cut vegetables into the pressure cooker, sprinkle some salt, add 1/4 cup of water and cover the pressure cooker.
1. Place the weight on and allow the vegetables to pressure cook for about 2 two whistles.
1. After two whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for about 3 to 4 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Release the pressure immediately, by placing the pressure cooker under running water.
1. Once the pressure is released, open the cooker.
1. Transfer the steamed vegetables to a serving bowl.
1. Our next step, we will make the Coconut Base for the Kerala Avial.
1. To do this, place the coconut, green chillies, cumin seeds into the mixer.
1. Add a little warm water and blend to make an almost smooth paste.
1. Add the coconut mixture to the steamed vegetables, add a tablespoon of coconut oil, torn curry leaves and give the Kerala Avial a stir.
1. Adjust the salt to suit your taste.
