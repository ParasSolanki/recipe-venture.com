### Ingredients

- 1 sprig Curry leaves - roughly torn.
- 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- 1/2 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- Sunflower Oil - for cooking.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 3 Potatoes (Aloo) - peeled and cut into wedges.
- 1 Broccoli - cut into florets.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Broccoli And Aloo Poriyal Recipe (Broccoli & Potato Stir Fry), first prepare all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. We will cook the broccoli and potatoes separately, as each one of them have separate cooking times.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in Kadai/ Wok; add the mustard seeds and allow them to crackle.
1. Add the cut potatoes, sprinkle salt and stir fry them until cooked through.
1. Cover the pan while the potatoes are cooking, so the steam created will make them cook faster.
1. Once the potatoes are done, add the turmeric powder and red chilli powder.
1. Saute till the spices get well coated into the potatoes.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and transfer the potatoes to a dish and keep aside.
1. In the same Kadai/ Wok, heat half a teaspoon if oil and add the cut broccoli florets.
1. Sprinkle some salt and stir fry until the broccoli is just about cooked through.
1. If you over cook them, they will become soggy when you mix with the potatoes.
1. Cover the pan while cooking so the steam created makes the broccoli cook faster.
1. Once the broccoli is cooked through, stir in the roasted potatoes.
1. Check the salt and spices, adjust to suit your taste and serve.
1. Serve the Broccoli and Potato Poriyal Recipe along with a bowl of Thakkali Rasam (Tomato Rasam) and Steamed Rice for a comforting meal.
