1. Add onion, coconut, green chilli, ginger, coriander, Curry leaves, cumin seeds and salt in a wide mixing bowl.
1. Mix it nicely by crushing onions with your hands for few minutes.
1. This brings out more flavor from all ingredients.
1. Add rava and sour curd to it.
1. Add water and mix it nicely to form a moist dough.
1. Let rava dough rest for 10- 15 minutes.
1. This will help rava to fluff up a bit and also you will observe that rava would have taken in all the liquids and the dough would have thickened.
1. Add some water or curd to loosen the dough.
1. Make the dough thicker than idli batter but a little watery to work, than chapati dough.
1. The dough should be easy to spread / pat with hands.
1. Keep a Tawa on the flame.
1. Sprinkle few drops of oil on the tava and spread all over the pan.
1. Grease a plastic sheet / aluminum foil / parchment paper /banana leaf /wet muslin cloth.
1. Take a large lemon sized dough and pat it evenly with your hands to a thin rotti.
1. Wet your hands in between with water to ease the patting.
1. Heat the griddle.
1. When it is hot, put the sheet with dough on the griddle to transfer the rotti to the hot griddle.
1. After a few seconds, remove the sheet carefully from the tawa such that the rotti remains n the tawa and the flat bread is intact and not torn.
1. Do it steadily and take care not to burn the sheet/cloth used to make the rotti.
1. Cook rotti on a medium heat.
1. Pour a few drops of oil all over the rotti.
1. Cover and cook till one side becomes slightly brown in color.
1. Then take out lid, flip the rotti and continue cooking for about a minute or so until the rotti becomes crispy on both sides.
1. Rava rotti is ready to be served with Coconut Chutney, Chutney Podi and Butter to top it up.
1. Enjoy them as your hearty weekday breakfast / Snack / Dinner.
