1. Remove a piece of mango and smash with spoon/ladle.
1. If it crushes easily, mangoes are done.
1. Once the mango is soft and cooked, smash the pieces gently with the back of a ladle/masher, making sure to be careful that the oil doesn't splash out of the pan.
1. Add salt to taste, chilli powder, hing and the powdered methi and stir well to combine.
1. Sauté on low flame for 5 minutes till the raw taste of the masalas goes away.
