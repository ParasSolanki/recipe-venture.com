1. After about 5 minutes, grease your palms with ghee and take a tablespoon of the aam peda mixture on your palm and shape up into a ball.
1. Press it a little to give it a disc shape and place on a plate.
1. I have used my icing tip coupler to slightly press on these pedhas in order to make a design, but you can skip this step if you like them plain.
1. Repeat for all the amm peda and then you can just press 1 or 2 slit almonds on top of each aam peda.
