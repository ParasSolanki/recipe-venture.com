### Instructions

1. To begin making the Aloo Methi Sabzi Recipe; we will first get the potatoes boiled till firm yet cooked.
1. I like to refrigerate the boiled potatoes for a couple of hours before roasting them in a pan.
1. Making the Aloo Methi Sabzi is a three stage process.
1. first cooking the methi leaves and then roasting the potatoes along with spices and finally tossing methi and aloo together.
1. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat; add the chopped methi leaves and saute until the methi leaves become soft and wilt down.
1. Sprinkle a little salt and keep aside.
1. Next,  heat oil in a pan over medium heat; add the cumin seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Add the onions, ginger and garlic and saute until the onions are soft and tender.
1. Add the boiled and peeled potatoes, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, amchur, coriander powder, garam masala powder and salt.
1. Stir well to combine all the ingredient and turn the heat to low to roast the potatoes along with the spices for a good 10 minutes.
1. After 10 minutes, once the potatoes have absorbed all the masala, add the cooked methi leaves and toss for less than a minute to combine to make the delicious tasting Aloo Methi Sabzi.
1. Give it a taste and adjust the spices accordingly.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and transfer the Aloo Methi Sabzi to a serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve the Aloo Methi Sabzi along with Tawa Paratha and Kadhi for a quick weeknight dinner with your family.
1. You can also serve Kachumber Salad with this meal to make it more filling and nutritious.
