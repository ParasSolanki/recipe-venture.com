### Ingredients

- 1 Green Chilli - finely chopped.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Whole Black Peppercorns - coarsely pounded.
- 1 cup White Urad Dal (Whole).
- 1/4 cup Fresh coconut - grated.
- Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - small bunch.
- 1/2 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- Sunflower Oil - for pan frying.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mysore Bonda Recipe, soak the urad dal completely immersed in water for about 2 hours.
1. Once the dal is soaked, get the remaining ingredients ready and the Kuzhi Paniyaram Pan ready as well.
1. Drain all the excess water from the urad dal and grind it along with the green chilli adding very little water to make a smooth and yet thick bonda batter.
1. Transfer the bonda batter into a large mixing bow, add the pounded peppercorns, salt, asafoetida and coriander leaves.
1. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Preheat the Kuzhi Paniyaram Pan; add a teaspoon of oil into each of the cavities.
1. Spoon the Mysore Bonda batter into each of the cavities and fill it 3/4th way through.
1. Cover the pan and allow the top of the bonda's to steam and cook through.
1. Once you notice the top of the bonda's are cooked through, then uncover the pan.
1. From this stage onwards we will pan fry the bonda's in open.
1. Flip the bonda's to cook on the other side.
1. You can optionally add more oil to make the bonda's more crisp and browned evenly from all sides.
1. Serve the Mysore Bonda's along with Coconut Chutney as a tea time snack along with a hot cup of coffee.
