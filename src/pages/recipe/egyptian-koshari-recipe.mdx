### Instructions

1. To begin making the Egyptian Koshari Recipe, first prepare the Baharat spice blend.
1. To do this, dry roast the whole spices (excluding nutmeg) in a pan on medium heat, without burning them.
1. Cool them down and then grind into a powder in a mixer or coffee grinder, along with ground cinnamon and nutmeg.
1. Store in dry, airtight container and use as needed.
1. Next, prepare the rice.
1. To do this, warm some olive oil in a pan and add washed and drained rice to it.
1. Saute the rice for 5 minutes and add the vegetable stock or water and bring it to boil.
1. Then, cover the pan and cook on a low heat for 10-15 minutes or until rice is done.
1. Meanwhile, wash and soak brown lentils in enough water.
1. Cook them in a sauce pan, covered, for 30 minutes in a pan with garlic, cumin and bay leaf and 3 cups of water.

1. Set aside until later use.
1. Cook the macaroni/vermicelli as per packet instructions in a pot of water and set aside while you prepare the sauce.
1. To make the sauce, place a pan on the heat and add some olive oil.

1. Add the tomato puree, baharat mix, salt, pepper, chilli flakes and red wine vinegar.
