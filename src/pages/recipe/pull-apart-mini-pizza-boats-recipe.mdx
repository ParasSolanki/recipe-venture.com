### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pull Apart Mini Pizza Boats Recipe, we will firstly make the pizza dough.
1. In a glass cup or bowl, add yeast and sugar; pour warm water over it and keep it aside.
1. After 5 minutes, it should have started to bubble up if the yeast is active.
1. If not, discard this mixture and try again.
1. Take whole wheat flour in a large bowl.
1. Add salt to taste, Italian seasoning and oil.
1. Pour the proved yeast mixture over this and mix well to form a soft dough.
1. Keep adding flour until the dough becomes soft and smooth.
1. Knead for about 5 to 8 minutes.
1. Transfer to another greased bowl and turn the dough ball to coat with oil evenly.
1. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled; about 1 to 1-1/2 hours, depending upon the temperature in the room.
1. The next step is to make the pizza sauce.
1. Blend tomatoes, onions, garlic and green chillis in a blender jar until smooth and finely pureed.
1. Transfer this to a large saucepan along with tomato puree, salt, sugar and Italian seasoning.
1. Adjust seasoning, salt and sugar according to taste.
1. Mix well and bring to boil.
1. Reduce heat and simmer until thick, about 20 to 30 minutes.
1. Keep aside.
1. To make the pizza boat filling, in a saucepan, heat oil.
1. Add finely chopped onions, garlic and green chillies.
1. Sauté on medium high heat until the onions are soft.
1. Stir in finely chopped mushrooms and sauté again for a few seconds on high.
1. Then add finely chopped bell pepper, salt to taste and dried oregano along with crushed red chilli pepper.
1. Give it a good mix and cook for a few seconds on high and remove from heat; once cool, stir in mozzarella cheese.
1. Filling is ready.
1. Next, Preheat oven to 350 F or 180 C.
1. Grease a 6 to 8 inch loose-bottomed pan with oil on the bottom and on the sides.
1. Divide pizza dough into 2 parts.
1. Roll one into a large round shape and cut into smaller rounds using a round cookie cutter about 3 inches in diameter.
1. Roll each round from 2 opposite ends until they are a little distance apart from each other.
1. Join the other 2 opposite ends to form a boat shape.
1. Pinch well.
1. Make similar dough boats with the other rounds.
1. Now, fill each dough boat with the filling until almost to the top.
1. Arrange these filled pizza boats into the prepared loose-bottomed pan starting from the outer edge in an angled fashion, ending up in the center.
1. Once the pan is filled with the pizza boats, place in preheated oven to bake for 18 to 25 minutes, until golden brown.
1. Remove from oven and brush the tops with melted butter.
