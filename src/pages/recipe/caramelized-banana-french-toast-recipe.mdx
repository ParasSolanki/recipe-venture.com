### Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons Milk.
- 4 tablespoon Butter.
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- 3 teaspoons Sugar.
- 1 teaspoon Cinnamon Powder (Dalchini).
- 2 Ripe Bananas - sliced.
- 4 tablespoons Butter.
- 1 pinch Salt.
- 4 tablespoon Sugar.
- 4 Whole Eggs.
- 8 Whole Wheat Brown Bread.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Caramelized Banana French Toast Recipe first whisk together all the ingredients mentioned under french toast except bread and butter.
1. Place a pan on a medium heat and melt some butter in it.
1. Dip each thick slice of bread in the eggy mixture, soak it on both sides, and then transfer it to the warm pan.
1. Once the butter starts foaming, place the bread slices in the pan.
1. Cook each side for 3 minutes on medium heat, until it gets golden and crispy.
1. In another pan, melt butter and add sugar to it.
1. Keep the heat on low so the sugar melts and caramelises gradually, a high heat will cause it to burn.
1. As soon as the sugar melts and turns light golden brown, add the bananas and vanilla extract and allow the bananas to cook till the sugar is syrupy and the bananas have caramelized.
1. Place the french toasts in a plate, top with caramelized bananas and syrup.
1. Serve Caramelized Banana French Toast along with Cold Coffee Smoothie for an indulgent breakfast, or even pack it in a snack box.
