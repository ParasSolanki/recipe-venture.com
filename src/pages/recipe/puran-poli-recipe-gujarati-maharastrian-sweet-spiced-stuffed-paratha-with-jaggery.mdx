### Ingredients

- Ghee - for cooking/ serving.
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 1 cup Arhar dal (Split Toor Dal).
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2 tablespoons Gram flour (besan) - or more if required.
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 10 Saffron strands.
- 3/4 cup Jaggery.
- 1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg powder.
- 2 tablespoons Sunflower Oil.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Gujarati Puran Poli Recipe, we will first make the dough.
1. Add whole wheat flour into a large bowl; add salt and combine it with little water at a time and knead until the dough gathers together to form a firm dough yet soft dough.
1. Add the 2 tablespoons of oil to coat the dough and knead for a couple of more minutes until smooth and firm.
1. Cover and let the dough sit in a cool place until we get the puran filling ready.
1. Divide the dough into 6 portions.
1. Soak the dal for 15 to 20 minutes in water.
1. Add the soaked dal with 1-1/4 cups of water (includes the soaked water) into the pressure cooker and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whisltes and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure releases, give the dal a quick mash.
1. The next step is the make the puran filling.
1. Into a heavy bottomed pan, add the cooked dal, and jaggery.
1. Keep stirring until the jaggery dissolves completely.
1. Stir in the saffron, cardamom and nutmeg to the jaggery mixture until well combined to make the puran poli filling.
1. Add the besan at this point and mix it into the dal mixture and ensure it blends well without any lumps.
1. Continue stirring the puran poli mixture until the dal mixture begins to thicken and leaves the sides of the pan.
1. At this point turn off the heat and allow the puran poli mixture to cool completely.
1. Divide the dough and puran mixture into 6 portions.
1. Keeping a little flour for dusting handy on a plate; roll out the puran poli dough into 3 inch diameter circles.
1. Place a portion of the puran poli mixture into the center of the circle.
1. Bring edges of the circle towards the center and fold over to cover the entire filling; making sure the edges are all sealed well by pinching them together if there is any opening.
1. Flatten the stuffed dough; dust over a little flour and roll gently into a 4 to 6 inch diameter circle taking care not to put too much pressure as the puran can come out of the dough.
1. Preheat a skillet on medium high; place the rolled puran poli onto the skillet to cook until golden brown on both sides.
1. At this point you can cook it along with ghee to make the puran poli crisp and delicious.
1. Or you can make a dry puran poli and serve it along with ghee.
1. Repeat the above process for all the remaining dough and puran portions.
1. Serve the Gujarati Puran Poli hot with ghee smeared on the top as it is or along with Undhiyu and Gujarati Kadhi to make a delicious meal.
