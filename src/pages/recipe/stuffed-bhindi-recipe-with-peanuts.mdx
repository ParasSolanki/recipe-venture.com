### Instructions

1. To begin making the Stuffed Bhindi With Peanuts Recipe, in a small bowl combine all the ingredients for the filling including roasted peanuts, sesame seeds, coriander powder, garam masala powder, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, amchur, gram flour, sugar, salt, oil and keep aside.
1. Wash the bhindi and dry them completely with a clean kitchen towel.
1. Slit them lengthwise in such a way that the ends don’t separate and don’t become two halves.
1. Fill a small amount of the filling mixture into the slit portion of the bhindi.
1. Once filled close the sides by bring them together.
1. You could leave them as whole filled fingers or cut the filled fingers into half from the center.
1. Heat olive oil in a heavy bottomed pan on medium heat; add onion, ginger and garlic and saute until softened.
1. Add the tomatoes and cook until softened.
1. Stir in salt, turmeric powder, red chilli powder.
1. Once tomatoes have softened, keep them aside.
1. In the same pan or another pan, heat some more oil and gently stir in the filled bhindi.
1. Turn the heat to low and simmer with the pan covered for about two minutes.
1. After about a couple of minutes, uncover the pan; give a gentle stir to the lady fingers turning them around and allowing them to cook in the open until they become tender.
1. You will notice the color changes from green to a pale green with roasted brown spots and the bhindi would have also shrunk in size; this indicates that it is cooked.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Stir in the cooked tomato mixture to the bhindi and toss to coat well.
1. Once bharva bhindi is done, turn off heat and transfer the bhindi to a serving platter.
1. Garnish with grated coconut and chopped coriander leaves and serve.
1. Serve the Stuffed Bhindi With Peanuts along with Tawa Paratha and Kadhi for a wholesome lunch or dinner.
1. You can also serve Khamang Kakdi along with this meal.
