### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Icing Sugar.
- Chocolate Shavings.
- 3 Ripe Bananas.
- 2 Avocados.
- 4 tablespoons Instant Coffee Powder.
- 1/2 cup Cocoa Powder.
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract.
- Decorative sugar (Cake/ Candy Sprinkles).
- 200 grams Dark chocolate.
- 2 tablespoons Sugar.
- 200 ml Coconut milk - (refrigerated for 6 to 8 hours).

### Instructions

1. To begin making this Vegan Guilt Free Chocolate Espresso Mousse Recipe, first melt the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl.
1. Place all the dark chocolate in the bowl and microwave it at 20 seconds intervals until it has just melted.
1. Take care not to overheat the chocolate.
1. Once melted, remove it from the microwave and give it a quick mix.
1. Set it aside in the bowl to cool down a bit.
1. While the chocolate is melting, make a coffee decoction as below or prepare the espresso in a coffee machine using fresh coffee beans.
1. To make the decoction add 1/4 cup warm water to 4 tablespoons of instant coffee powder and stir well to make a coffee decoction.
1. When ready, and the chocolate has cooled, add coffee decoction to melted chocolate and mix it well.
1. Next add the ripe bananas, ripe avocados, melted chocolate with coffee, cocoa powder and sugar into a blender and blitz into a smooth paste.
1. Do not add any water at this stage as we want the mixture to be thick.
1. This will help it set like mousse.
1. Transfer the fruit and chocolate espresso mixture for the mousse into 6 individual serving cups or a large serving bowl and chill it in the refrigerator, until it is set (about 8 hours).
1. Pouring it into individual bowls will help set it faster, whereas a big serving bowl may take a while longer.
1. While the dessert is getting set we will proceed to make the Vegan Coconut Milk Whipped Cream.
1. To make the Coconut Whipped Cream, it is important for the coconut milk to be refrigerated for 6 to 8 hours.
1. This refrigeration process helps thicken the coconut milk.
1. Remove the excess liquids after refrigeration and use only the solids.
1. Using a cloth mesh strainer will help separate the whey.
1. Place the refrigerated coconut milk in a chilled mixing bowl, add the icing sugar and vanilla essence.
1. Using an electric beater, whisk until it forms stiff peaks.
1. Refrigerate this coconut cream until you are ready to use it.
1. When you are ready to serve, garnish the Vegan Chocolate Espresso Mousse with whipped coconut milk cream and some chocolate shavings.
1. Enjoy the guilt free Vegan Chocolate Espresso Mousse at the end of a Weekend Dinner or Dinner Party.
1. Serve Vegan Guilt Free Chocolate Espresso Mousse Recipe as dessert after a meal of  Loaded Veggie Nachos Recipe - A Delicious Mexican Appetizer and Red Bean Mexican Burrito Bowl Recipe - Roz Ka Khana With Figaro Olive Oil.
