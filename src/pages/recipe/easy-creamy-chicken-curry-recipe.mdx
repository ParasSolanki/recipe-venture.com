### Instructions

1. To begin making the Easy Creamy Chicken Curry Recipe, we will firstly marinate the chicken.
1. In a bowl, add lemon juice, salt and yogurt and mix well.
1. Add chicken pieces, mix well so that the chicken is properly coated with the marination.
1. Once done keep it aside for an hour.
1. You can also keep it aside overnight.
1. To make the curry, heat the required oil in a heavy bottomed pan.
1. Once the oil is a little hot, add garlic, ginger, a little water and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Next, add the chicken pieces one by one while shaking off the excess marinade.
1. Without disturbing the chicken cook it on one side for about 5 minutes on high heat so that it browns a bit.
1. This step will improve the look and the depth of flavour.
1. Flip the chicken pieces and continue cooking undisturbed for a further 5 minutes.
1. Pour over rest of the marinade on the chicken.
1. Cook the creamy chicken curry covered for about 25 minutes on slow flame.
1. After about 25 minutes, remove the lid and give the creamy chicken curry a good stir.
1. If needed add more water.
1. Once the chicken is cooked, add cream, black pepper powder and kasuri methi.
1. Mix everything and let the creamy chicken curry come to a boil.
1. Once it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and serve hot.
1. Serve Easy Creamy Chicken Curry along with Tawa Paratha, Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita and Jeera Rice for an everyday meal with your family.
