### Ingredients

- Sugar - to taste or drizzle with honey.
- Mixed nuts - as required.
- 350 ml Milk.
- 1/2 cup Broken Wheat (Dalia/ Godumai Rava) - (I used the smaller grains).
- 1 teaspoon Fennel seeds (Saunf).
- Fresh fruits - as required.
- 2 cups Water.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Meetha Dalia - Broken Wheat Porridge recipe, we have to first dry the broken wheat.
1. Add the broken wheat to a pan placed on low heat and roast till it becomes golden brown.
1. To the same pan, add water and fennel seeds to it and cook till it softens.
1. Next add milk and let the contents come to a boil.
1. Simmer on medium-low flame till milk and broken wheat are well assimilated and start to thicken just a little bit.
1. Switch off the heat.
1. Stir in the sugar.
1. Allow the contents to cool or serve warm with fruits of your choice.
1. If you intend to have the porridge with fruits, ensure that it is not hot, else, the fruits will release water and turn mushy.
1. (And it might taste bad)Serve Meetha Daliya on its own or along with a hot cup of Espresso Coffee for a weekday breakfast.
