### Instructions

1. To begin making the Homemade Harissa Recipe, all you need is a set of basic ingredients.
1. Make sure you have all of them ready and kept aside.
1. The first step is to roast the red bell peppers, you can roast them in the oven on in a wok.
1. I personally prefer roasting it in the wok, as it gets done faster and gets great flavors as well.
1. Heat a teaspoon of oil in the wok, add the garlic, the chopped red bell peppers and sprinkle some salt.
1. Stir fry the red bell pepper on medium heat until well roasted and softened.
1. Once you notice the peppers are roasted and softened turn off the heat.
1. In the next step, we have to roast the coriander, cumin and chillies.
1. Heat a small pan on medium heat and add the coriander, cumin seeds and dry red chillies.
1. Roast on medium heat until you smell the aromas coming through.
1. This will take less than 2 minutes.
1. The next step is to process all the ingredients in a food processor.
1. Add the roasted peppers, the roasted coriander and cumin and the remaining ingredients including the olive oil into the food processor.
1. Process all the ingredients to make a smooth paste.
1. The Harissa Paste is now ready for used as a condiment in a variety of dishes like Harissa Roasted Carrot Pizza with Pomegranate Sauce & Greek Yogurt, Couscous Eggplant And Tomato Gratin Recipe and more.
