1. To prepare Surti Obbattu, mix semolina, maida, 1 tablespoon of ghee and enough water to make a soft dough, cover and set it aside for 30 minutes to rest.
1. Add the remaining ghee in a pan and roast the almond, cashews, sultanas and coconut on a low flame and toss in the sugar and cardamom and cook until any water evaporates.
1. Dish it into a bowl.
1. In a pan, add all the ingredients for soaking surti obbattu and bring it to a boil and let it cool until use.
1. This is to warm when needed.
1. In a mixer jar, add the soaked and peeled almonds and grind coarsely.
1. Add this along with the other ingredients for the badam milk to be spooned on top of soaked surti obbattu and bring it to a boil in a pan and turn off the flame and set aside until needed, to cool it as well.
1. Divide the dough into 8 portions and roll it out into pooris and deep fry in hot oil.
1. This must be done quickly and must not sit in the oil for too long.
1. These pooris need not be crispy.
