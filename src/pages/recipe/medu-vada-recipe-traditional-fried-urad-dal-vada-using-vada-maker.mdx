### Ingredients

- 1 Green Chilli - finely chopped.
- Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - small bunch.
- 1 inch Ginger.
- 1 cup White Urad Dal (Whole) - soaked for 2 hours.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Traditional South Indian Medu Vada Recipe; we will first soak the dal for about 2 hours.
1. Using a strainer, strain all the excess water from the urad dal.
1. We need to use very little water to grind the urad dal, so that you can shape them well if you are deep frying.
1. Next we will grind the dal along with the ginger using a blender into a very smooth batter.
1. Make sure add very little water while grinding the dal to make a smooth batter.
1. Transfer the batter to a bowl.
1. Make sure add very little water while grinding the dal to make a smooth and thick batter.
1. Transfer the batter to a bowl.
1. Add the salt, green chillies and chopped coriander and stir well to combine the ingredients well into the medu vada batter.
1. Cover the vada batter and allow it to rest until we preheat the oil.
1.  This resting process will allow the batter to fluff a little and making it ready to make the vada's.
1. Preheat the oil for deep frying the medu vada's.
1. I am using the Medu Vada maker to make the shapes for the traditional vada.
1. Using the Medu Vada MakerSpoon the batter into the Medu Vada Maker, using the instructions given on the mater, press the vada maker over the oil and allow the batter to form its shape through the hole.
1. As you notice a ring of batter come out of the vada maker, release the press and allow the vada to drop into the oil.
1. It might take not more than a couple of tries to get the perfect vada shape.
1. Deep fry the batter until it is browned evenly and crisp on both sides.
1. Strain the Medu Vada off the excess oil and place it on an absorbent paper.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining Medu Vadas.
1. Serve the Medu Vadas along with Vegetable Sambar and Coconut Chutney for breakfast or during special festivals like Pongal or Tamil New Year.
