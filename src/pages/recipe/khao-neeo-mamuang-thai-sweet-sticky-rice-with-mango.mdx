### Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons Sugar.
- 1 Mango (Ripe) - skin peeled and chopped.
- 1/2 cup Rice.
- 1 tablespoon Jaggery.
- 1 pinch Salt.
- 1 cup Coconut milk.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Thai Sweet Sticky Rice With Mango, peel the mango and keep it ready.
1. Soak the rice for at least 30 minutes with water, add the rice with the soaked water into a saucepan, add coconut milk, jaggery and salt as well and bring it to a boil.
1. Keep stirring so that rice does not stick to the bottom.
1. Boil until the water is almost evaporated.
1. When the rice is just boiled, switch off the heat and cover it with the lid and leave it for the rice to cook even more in the steam.
1. Move on to make the sauce, heat the coconut milk with sugar on to a pan and keep stirring until the sauce thickens and switch it off.
1. To assemble, take out a bowl, mix the cooked rice and spoon out and place it in the bowl, add chopped mangoes by the side and pour the sauce on the top and serve.
1. Serve the Thai Style Khao Niaow Ma Muang Recipe after Thai flavoured Vegetarian Thai Green Curry Recipe or Pad Thai for your main course.
