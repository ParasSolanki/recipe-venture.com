### Instructions

1. To begin making the Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe, we will first make the paratha dough.
1. For the dough, in a large bowl, add in the ragi flour, whole wheat flour and required salt.
1. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.
1. Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough.
1. Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the paratha dough is smooth and elastic.
1. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.
1. Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead a little more.
1. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.
1. Divide the dough into equal portions.
1. Cover the ragi paratha dough and allow it to rest until you get the filling ready.
1. The next step is to make the Paneer filling for the Ragi ParathaIn a mixing bowl, combine the grated paneer green chillies, freshly chopped mint leaves, salt to taste, cumin powder, Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients well.
1. Divide the filling into equal portions.
1. This process of dividing and keeping the portions for paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.
1. The final step is to stuff the filling into the ragi paratha dough.
1. Dust the ragi paratha dough in flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface.
1. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter.
1. Take a portion of paneer filling and place it in the center.
1. Next gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together.
1. Remove the little excess dough which popped out when you brought them together.
1. Press the filled ragi paneer paratha dough down.
1. Dust the filled paneer paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying just a pressure.
1. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.
1. Preheat skillet on medium heat and grease it with little oil.
1. Place the filled ragi paneer paratha.
1. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.
1. Spread a little oil over the paratha and keep pressing the ragi paneer stuffed parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.
1. Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly.
1. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.
1. Once the Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe is cooked transfer to a plate.
1. Continue to the same process with the remaining parathas the same way.
1. Serve this Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe along with Spring Onion and Peanut Raita Recipe and Amla Achaar Recipe for a hearty and healthy high protein breakfast or an indian diabetic breakfast or lunch.
