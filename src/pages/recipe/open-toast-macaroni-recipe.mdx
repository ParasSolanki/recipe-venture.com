### Ingredients

- 250 grams Macaroni pasta.
- 1 tablespoon All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 2 tablespoons Roasted tomato pasta sauce.
- 4 Whole Wheat Brown Bread.
- 1 tablespoon Butter.
- 4 sprig Basil leaves.
- Salt - (adjust according to your taste).
- 1 1/2 cup Milk.
- 1 cup Cheese - grated.
- 1 teaspoon Black pepper powder.
- 1 teaspoon Dried Thyme Leaves.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Open Toast Marconi Recipe, we will first boil the macaroni pasta in water over a sauce pan.
1. Sprinkle some salt and boil it for over 20 minutes.
1. Check if the pasta is cooked, it has to be just Al-dante (just cooked).
1. When done, drain the water and wash the pasta over cold running water and drizzle some olive oil to freeze the cooking process.
1. We will move on to making the sauce for the pasta.
1. Heat a sauce pan with 1 tablespoon butter.
1. As the butter starts melting.
1. Add a tablespoon of maida and whisk using a whisker and you will see the maida starts to crumble a bit.
1. As soon as the butter and maida combines, you can add milk and start whisking to prevent any lumps.
1. Add in pepper powder, thyme, pasta sauce, salt and keep whisking it.
1. You can adjust the consistency of the sauce as you wish by adding some more milk.
1. Once the consistency is set right, add in the grated cheese, freshly torn basil leaves and boiled pasta.
1. Give it a stir so that the pasta coats really well with the sauce.
1. Switch off the heat and set aside.
1. Heat another flat skillet over a medium heat.
1. Spread the butter on either side of the bread and toast it on to the tawa.
1. Toast for about 2 minutes on either side until it is golden brown.
1. Take the toast out and add 2 tablespoons of the mac and cheese on top and serve warm.
1. Serve the Open Toast Marconi Recipe along with a glass of Plum Ginger Juice and White Bean Salad with Onions and Bell peppers by the side.
