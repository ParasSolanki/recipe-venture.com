### Instructions

1. To begin making the Healthy Black Bean Stuffed Burrito With Amaranth And Quinoa, first cook the grains.
1. To do that, place a sauce pan with 1-1/2 cups of water on the heat and bring it to a boil along with required salt.
1. Once its at a rolling boil, stir in the mixed grains.
1. Turn the heat down to low, cover the saucepan and allow it to cook/simmer for for about 15 minutes or until grains are cooked and the water is absorbed completely.
1. When the grains are cooked fully, turn off the heat, drain off any additional liquid if any, add one teaspoon of olive oil and fluff the grains up using a fork.
1. Keep this aside for later use.
1. Meanwhile combine the drained beans with the garlic, add adequate water and salt and place it all in a pressure cooker.
1. Put the pressure cooker on the heat and cook the beans until you hear 2-3 whistles.
1. Turn the heat to low and allow it to cook for 3-4 minutes more and turns he cooker off.
1. When the pressure releases naturally, take the lid off and ensure that the beans are tender, cooked but not mushy.
1. Drain the beans out of the water in which they were pressure cooked and run them under cold water.
1. Keep aside for later use.
1. Next, warm up the tortillas and keep them wrapped in a cotton kitchen towel, until later use.
1. In a medium mixing bowl add the cooked grains, cooked beans, chopped coriander, chopped bell pepper, steamed corn, olive oil and lemon juice and stir to combine.
1. To assemble the burritos, place the tortillas on a work surface.
1. Start with a big scoop of prepared beans + grain mixture and spread evenly across the tortillas.
1. Over it, scoop half a teaspoon each of sweet spicy mango pickle and a dollop of sour cream on the top.
1. Next, sprinkle some shredded cheese over each.
1. Fold the sides in to make a tight parcel, or roll it up into a cylindrical wrap so the filling stays intact.
