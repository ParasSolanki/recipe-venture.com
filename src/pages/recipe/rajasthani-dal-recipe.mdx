### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rajasthani Dal, we will first soak the moong dal and chana dal in 3 cups of water for about 3 hours.
1.  Heat ghee in a pressure cooker over medium heat; add the cumin seeds and allow it to crackle.
1. Add the onion, green chillies, ginger and garlic and saute until the onion softends.
1. Add the bay leaf and cinnamon stick and saute for a few seconds until you can smell the aromas coming through.
1. Next add the tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chilli powder, hing and saute for about a minute until the tomatoes have slightly softened.
1. Once the tomatoes have softened, add the soaked dals, salt to taste and add water if required such that the water is at least 2 inches above the level of dal.
1. Cover the pressure cooker, and pressure cook the Rajasthani Dal for about 5 to 6 whistles - about 20 minutes until it is completely cooked through.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. Once the pressure has released, check if the dals are cooked well to perfection.
1. Once pressed between fingers it should mash easily.
1. Stir in the juice from the lemon and the coriander leaves and transfer the Rajasthani Dal to a serving bowl.
1. The next is the tadka, heat ghee in a pan over medium heat.
1. Add the cumin seeds and red chillies and allow it to roast for a few seconds.
1. Turn off the heat and add this tadka to the Rajasthani Dal.
1. Serve the Rajasthani Panchmel Dal along with Bati or eat it along Spicy Paneer Pulao With Vegetables followed by the mouth-watering Traditional Rasmalai Recipe.
