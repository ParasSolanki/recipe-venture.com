### Ingredients

- Salt - to taste.
- 2 Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- 2 cloves Garlic - finely chopped.
- 1 cup Methi Leaves (Fenugreek Leaves).
- Figaro Pure Olive Oil - as needed.
- 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Methi Lachha Paratha wash the methi leaves thoroughly and chop them finely.
1. In a mixing bowl, add the all the ingredients like the chopped methi leaves, whole wheat flour, green chillies, garlic, salt  and knead it into a soft dough.
1. Rest it for 10 minutes.
1. After 10 minutes, knead for a minute again until the paratha dough is soft and pliable.
1. Divide the dough into 10 equal portions.
1. Preheat a skillet over medium heat.
1. If you are using a cast iron skillet, then grease the skillet well and allow it to preheat.
1. Keep some flour aside for dusting while rolling the dough.
1. Shape each dough portion into a round ball, press it between the palm of your hands.
1. Dust the dough with flour and roll it into a 6-inch diameter circle.
1. Smear some ghee or oil on this rolled out the dough.
1. Dust some flour over the ghee.
1. This flour and ghee will help the Methi lachha paratha split itself into layers.
1. Begin folding the Methi lachha paratha dough like an accordion, similar to a saree pleat.
1. Start from one end of the dough and reach the end.
1. The dough is essentially made into a pleat.
1. Once you have stacked up all the pleats one over the other, roll the dough into a swiss roll.
1. Flatten the pleated swiss roll between the palm of your hands, dust in flour and roll into a 4 to 5-inch diameter circle.
1. You will be able to see the layers very clearly.
1. Place the rolled layered Methi Lachha Paratha on the preheated skillet.
1. Cook on medium heat on both sides for a few seconds, then smear ghee and cook until golden brown and cooked through completely.
1. Proceed the same way with the remaining portions of the paratha dough.
1. Serve the Methi Lachha Paratha along with Mango Achar, Paneer Butter Masala or your favorite Vegetarian Gravy for a weeknight dinner or even for breakfast along with a chutney.
