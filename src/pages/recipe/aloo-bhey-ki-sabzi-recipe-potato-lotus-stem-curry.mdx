### Instructions

1. To begin making the Aloo Bhey Ki Sabzi Recipe, we will first prep all the various components.
1. First of all, place the ingredients listed under “Ingredients to be made into a paste” into a blender and grind them down into a smooth paste.
1. Pour it into a bowl and set it aside for later.
1. Then add 3 small tomatoes into the blender and blend them to a puree.
1. Pour the puree into a bowl and set that aside too.
1. Now to make the sabzi, heat some oil in a pressure cooker.
1. When it is warm enough, add asafetida and cumin seeds and let them crackle.
1. Next add the prepared onion garlic paste and saute well for 3-4 minutes until the paste turns golden-brown and the raw smell goes away.
1. Next add the red chilli powder, turmeric and coriander powder.
1. Top with salt and continue to cook for 2 minutes more.
1. At this stage, when the masalas are all cooked through, pour in the prepared tomato puree and cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring continuously, until you see oil leaving the sides of the pan.
1. This is an indication that the masalas are cooked through.
1. Now add cubed potato and lotus stem rounds, stir well and cook for 2-3 minutes.
1. Top it up with 2 cups of water and cover the pressure.
1. Allow the sabzi to cook covered for 2 whistles.
1. Turn the heat off and allow the pressure to release natural.
1. When the weight can be lifted and the lid comes off with ease, open the cooked and simmer the sabzi for 5 minutes.
1. This will allow some excess water to evaporate.
1. At this stage you can taste for salt and spice and adjust both accordingly.
