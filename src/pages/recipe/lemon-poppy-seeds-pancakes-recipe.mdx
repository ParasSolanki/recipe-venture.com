### Instructions

1. To begin making Lemon Poppy Seeds Pancakes, first combine the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.
1. Add the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, baking powder, lemon zest, poppy seeds and mix well.
1. Set this aside while you prepare the wet ingredients.
1. In another bowl whisk together the egg with buttermilk, lemon juice, vanilla extract, oil and water.
1. Heat a griddle over medium heat and brush generously with butter.
1. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients into it slowly, while stirring to combine.
1. Ensure that there are no lumps.
1. When the griddle is hot enough pour about 1/4 cup of prepared batter in small circles.
1. Do not spread the batter.
1. Allow the pancakes to cook on a medium heat.
