- 1/4 cup Instant Oats (Oatmeal).
- 1 pinch Salt.
- 1 teaspoon Ghee.
- 1-1/2 cup Jaggery - (adjust).
- 1-1/2 cups Fresh coconut - grated.
- 20 Cashew nuts - halved.
- 5 Dates - chopped.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 2 teaspoons Raisins - more to garnish.
- 2 cups Water.
- 1/2 cup Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal).
- 1 tablespoon Rice flour.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Karwar Style Madgane Recipe With Oats & Rajgira, soak dal in adequate water for about an hour.
1. Wash thoroughly and drain.
1. Take a big saucepan, add the given quantity of dal and water and bring it to boil on high heat.
1. When the water in the pan starts boiling, reduce the flame to medium and keep simmered for the dal to cook, (do not cover with lid at any stage) stirring occasionally till soft and done.
1. In the meantime, grind the coconut using water to extract coconut milk by squeezing tightly the ground coconut over a sieve.
1. The first extract will be thick and should be about 3/4 to 1 cup.
1. Repeat this process using less water each time to get more coconut milk which will be comparatively thinner and the coconut milk should be about 2 cups.
1. Check the dal and when it is almost cooked, add to it the cashew nuts and mix well.
1. Here a little hot water can be added to daal if there is very less water in it.
1. When dal is completely cooked but not mushy (almost all water should be evaporated by now), add jaggery, cardamom powder and salt.
1. Stir till jaggery dissolves.
1. Using a little of the thin coconut extract make a slurry of the rice and rajgira flours in a mixing bowl.
1. (rice flour is a must as it prevents the coconut milk from splitting)Add this slurry, oats and all the thin coconut extract to the dal and bring to a boil stirring constantly.
1. Now add the dates, half of the raisins and the thick coconut extract and again bring to a boil stirring constantly on medium heat.
1. Switch off heat now since after adding coconut milk, too much cooking is not required not desirable for the recipe.
1. Heat ghee in a small kadai, add the cashew nuts and raisins (which were reserved) to garnish the Madgane.
1. Serve Karwar Style Madgane Recipe With Oats & Rajgira as a dessert with a meal of steamed rice, Karwar Style Sol Kadhi Recipe, and Kadgi Chakko Recipe for lunch.
