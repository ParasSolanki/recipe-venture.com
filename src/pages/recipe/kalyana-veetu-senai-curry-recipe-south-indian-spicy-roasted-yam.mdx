### Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 2 teaspoon Sambar Powder.
- Salt - to taste.
- Sunflower Oil - as required for frying.
- 250 grams Elephant yam (Suran/Senai/Ratalu) - cut into 1 inch thin pieces.
- 1/2 cup Fresh coconut - grated.
- 1 teaspoon Mustard seeds.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).
- 1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).
- Curry leaves - few.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Kalyana Veetu Senai Curry Recipe, add the cut yam pieces into a pressure cooker with 1/4 cup of water, 1/2 turmeric powder and salt and pressure cook the yam for one whistle and keep aside.
1. Preheat oil in a pan over medium heat; add the mustard seeds and allow it to splutter.
1. Once the mustard seeds crackle, stir in the hing and curry leaves and saute for few seconds.
1. After a few seconds, add the grated coconut and roast for about minute until it turns golden in colour and releases an aroma.
1. At this stage, add the red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, sambar powder and saute for a few seconds and add the cooked yam.
1. Stir well until all the masalas coat the yam - about a minute.
1. The yam, tends to get a little dry, as it combines with the masala; you could add a little more oil to help give the yam a little more crispy texture and also help the masalas to get absorbed well into the Senai Curry.
1. Once you notice the masalas are well coated and the Kalyana Veetu Senai Curry has a slightly roasted texture, check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and transfer the Kalyana Veetu Senai Curry to a serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve Kalyana Veetu Senai Curry along with Keerai Sambar and Steamed Rice for a weekday lunch.
1. You can also pack it in your Lunch Box along with Palak Raita and Tawa Paratha.
