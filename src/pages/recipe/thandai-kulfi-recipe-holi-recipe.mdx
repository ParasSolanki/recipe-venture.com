### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Poppy seeds.
- 2 teaspoons Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 8 Whole Black Peppercorns.
- 1/4 cup Badam (Almond) - blanched and peeled.
- 1/4 cup Cashew nuts.
- 1/4 cup Pistachios.
- 3 liter Milk - (I use 2% fat).
- 1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon Powder (Dalchini).
- 1/2 cup Sugar.
- 1 tablespoon Fennel seeds (Saunf).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Thandai Kulfi Recipe, first we will make a paste of the Thadai Masala by blending all the ingredients for the Thandai masala in a mixer grinder.
1. Keep this thandai masala aside.
1. To begin making the Kulfi Recipe, the first step is to have to condense the milk.
1. For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring it to boil.
1. Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity.
1. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.
1. This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste.
1. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.
1. Once it the milk is reduced to more than half of its quantity, stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely.
1. Finally stir in the Thandai Paste Mix and give the mixture a good stir.
1. You can even use a hand blender to give it a good whisk.
1. Turn off the heat and allow the kulfi mixture to cool completely.
1. Pour the thandai kulfi milk in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator.
1. The Thandai Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.
1. Once the Thandai Kulfi is frozen you can run the kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release on to the plate.
1. Serve Thandai Kulfi Recipe as a Indian dessert for parties or even make it as a special dessert for the festival of holi.
