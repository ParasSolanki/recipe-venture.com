### Ingredients

- Salt - as required.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 2 Green Chillies - slit.
- 1 inch Ginger.
- 10 Sardine fish.
- 10 Sichuan peppercorns.
- 5 Kokum (Malabar Tamarind).
- Dry coconut (kopra) - Handful or grated fresh coconut.
- 1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Tallyanche Suke Recipe, firstly remove and throw away the head and tail of Sardines.
1. Remove everything out from the belly, wash them thrice or four times using fresh water every time.
1. Apply a teaspoon of salt and keep it aside for 10 minutes.
1. In the meantime, crush the garlic and keep it aside.
1. Also crush the Sichuan Pepper for a few seconds to release the flavours.
1. Make sure that you don't have to make powder out of it.
1. The next step is to cook the Sardines.
1. In a medium saucepan, drop in the Sardines.
1. Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder, crushed ginger, slit green chilies, coconut and 1/4 cup water.
1. Mix it properly, cover with a lid and let it cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes.
1. After 10 minutes, remove the cover and check if the fish is cooked using a toothpick.
1. Once it is done, switch off the flame and add salt, dry kokum and crushed sichuan pepper.
1. Mix everything well by shaking the saucepan because at this point, sardines are cooked and delicate and if you mix with spoon or spatula too much, then they might release fish bones all over in the dish and mess it up.
1. Remove from heat and it is ready to be served.
1. Serve Tallyanche Suke as a side dish along with Goan Chana Ros and Steamed Rice for a delicious Goan meal.
