### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Caster Sugar - (powdered sugar).
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 1/2 cup Lukewarm Water - (adjust).
- 1 cup Water.
- 1 tablespoon Ghee.
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- Sunflower Oil - to deep fry.

### Instructions

1. To prepare Assamese Sweet Kordoi Recipe, mix together the flour and salt.
1. Add the ghee and mix.
1. Adding water gradually, knead until you have a smooth pliable dough.
1. Cover and keep aside for 15 minutes.
1. Make bigger balls of dough, about 2 inches in size.
1. On a lightly dusted surface, roll each dough ball into a small circle (about 5-6 inches) .
1. Using a sharp knife , cut 6-7 vertical and parallel lines into the dough circle , each line about 1/2 inch from the next.
1. Dont cut all the way through.
1. The lines should not reach the edge of the circle (about 1/4 inch from the edge).
1. Think of a slotted spoon !Starting from one end, roll the dough circle .
1. Pinch both the ends and push the ends gently towards the centre.
1. This will fluff up the centre and give the kordoi its characteristic shape like a start fruit.
1. Repeat with all the dough.
1. This measurement makes about 12 such kordoi.
1. Heat oil in a deep frying pan and fry the shaped kordoi in batches until golden brown and crisp.
1. Cool the kordoi, placing them on kitchen towels or tissue to drain excess oil.
1. Meanwhile, make the sugar syrup by bringing the sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan.
1. Simmer for few minutes until syrup is thick and sticky.
1. One by one, drop the kordoi into this syrup, turn over to the other side, and remove.
1. Serve Assamese Sweet Kordoi Recipe warm or cool, paired with Adrak Chai.
