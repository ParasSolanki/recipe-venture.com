### Instructions

1. To begin making the Brinjal Prawns Masala Curry Recipe , first prepare the tamarind extract for the curry.
1. Soak a lemon sized tamarind in 1/4 cup of hot water and keep aside for 15-20 minutes.
1. Later, squeeze this soaked tamarind pulp and get the extract into a separate bowl.
1. You can add a little extra water and extract more tamarind extract.
1. Now grind the onion, ginger, garlic, chillies, and coriander leaves together in a mixer grinder for the Brinjal Prawns Masala Curry Recipe.
1. Do not add water while grinding.
1. Keep the paste aside.
1. Heat oil in a heavy bottom pan and add the ground paste in it.
1. Saute for 2-3 minutes on medium flame.
1. After 2 to 3 minutes, add turmeric powder, red chili powder and sambar powder.
1. Mix it well and let it cook for about a minute.
1. This will help the raw smell go away from the onions.
1. After a minute, add the brinjal  and pinch of salt.
1. Cover and cook on low flame until the brinjal is well roasted.
1. Once the eggplants are cooked, add prawns, tomato puree, tamarind water and salt to taste.
1. Cover the pan with the lid and let it cook for 3-4 minutes as prawns donâ€™t take much time to cook.
1. Once the prawns are cooked, check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Once done, turn off the heat and transfer the Brinjal Prawns Masala Curry Recipe to a serving bowl.
1. Serve Brinjal Prawns Masala Curry Recipe along with Steamed Rice for a weekday lunch.
1. You can also serve Kachumber Salad and Beetroot Raita to complete the meal.
