### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- Salt and Pepper - to taste.
- 2 sprig Rosemary.
- 300 grams Cherry tomatoes.
- 3 cloves Garlic - finely chopped.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Roasted Cherry Tomato Soup Recipe first prepare the oven for roasting the tomatoes.
1. Set the oven to preheat at 180 C for about 15 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, in a baking tray spread the tomatoes evenly.
1. Drizzle the oil over them, sprinkle some salt and pepper over it and toss well so the tomatoes are well coated.
1. Scatter them around the tray.
1. Next, crush the garlic pods lightly in a mortar and pestle.
1. Scatter them on to the tray, in between the tomatoes.
1. Tear the rosemary leaves, lightly rub them between your palms or fingers and sprinkle all over the tomatoes in the tray.
1. Give it a good mix so the tomatoes are well coated.
1. Place the tray in the oven so the tomatoes will cook for about 1/2 hour or until they are crinkled and soft.
1. When done, take the tray out of the oven and place it on a rack to cool slightly.
1. Empty the tomatoes into a blender jar of a mixer-grinder and blend them into a smooth paste.
1. Pour the roasted tomato puree into a saucepan, add a cup of water and bring it to a boil.
1. Simmer along with salt and pepper, as needed.
1. Pour the soup into individual serving bowls and garnish it with toasted bagels or croutons.
1. Serve the Roasted Cherry Tomato Soup for a weeknight dinner, along with crusty Salad, or even as a starter at a dinner party.
