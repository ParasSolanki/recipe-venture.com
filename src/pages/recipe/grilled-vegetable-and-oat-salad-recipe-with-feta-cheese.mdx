### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Feta Cheese - crumbles.
- 200 grams Iceberg lettuce - torn.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1/2 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 4 sprig Parsley leaves - chopped for garnish.
- Black pepper powder - to taste.
- 1/2 teaspoon Lemon juice.
- 2 Carrots (Gajjar) - carrots.
- 1 teaspoon Mustard sauce.
- 250 grams Button mushrooms - washed with stems removed.
- 80 grams Rolled Oats Or Instant Oats.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Grilled Vegetable and Oat Salad Recipe with Feta Cheese, bring all the ingredients together and keep them ready.
1. Heat a wok on high heat with a teaspoon of oil; add in the oats, whole mushrooms and carrots.
1. Roast them on high heat until light brown spots appear and the carrots are lightly cooked through.
1. Donâ€™t add the salt while roasting as the oats have a lot of salt in them.
1. The oats will get lightly cooked (just enough for the salad) and absorb the moisture released from the mushrooms.
1. Once the vegetables are roasted, turn off the heat and allow them to cool completely.
1. Add the roasted vegetables, the lettuce into a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the lemon juice, pepper, mustard sauce and chopped parsley.
1. Stir well to combine.
1. Serve the Oat Salad warm along with feta crumbles on the top for a wholesome weeknight dinner along with a warm toasted bread and Cream Of Celery Soup.
