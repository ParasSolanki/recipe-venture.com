### Ingredients

- 1-1/4 cups White Urad Dal (Whole).
- 1 cup Soybeans (Whole Soya dal).
- Water - as required.
- 1 teaspoon Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal).
- 4 teaspoons Salt.
- 1 teaspoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).
- 2 cups Idli Rice.

### Instructions

1. To begin making high protein soya idli, we will first make the idli batter.
1. Soak the rice in water, such that the all the rice is completely immersed in water.
1. Let it soak for about 6 hours.
1. Soak the soya bean in water, such that the all the soya bean is completely immersed in water and the water is at least 2 inches above as the soya will absorb water and fluff up.
1. Let it soak for about 6 hours.
1. Soak the urad dal, methi seeds and chana dal in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water.
1. Let it soak for about 6 hours.
1. First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter.
1. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter.
1. The batter will look fluffy.
1. Pour this batter into a large container.
1. Next grind the soya bean into a fine smooth batter.
1. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter.
1. The batter will look fluffy.
1. Pour this batter into the urad dal.
1. Grind the rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter.
1. Adding too much water will make the dosa batter too watery.
1. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .
1. The rice batter is a little coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.
1. Combine the urad , soya bean and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments.
1. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.
1. Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.
1. To make the soya idlisGrease the idli molds with a little sesame oil or ghee.
1. This process is purely optional.
1. I like to do this as it adds to the flavor of the idli’s.
1. Pour spoonfuls of the batter into these moulds.
1. Do make sure you fill the soya idli batter only half way through as they will rise up to the top when steamed.
1. Once all the plates are filled, place the filled soya idli racks one above the other making sure the holes are facing the filled portion.
1. Prepare the idli steamer with a little water in the bottom.
1. Place the filled soya idli racks in the steamer.
1. Place the steamer on high heat and steam the idli’s for 10 minutes.
1. After 10 minutes of steaming, turn off the heat.
1. Open the steamer and insert a knife or a pick to test whether the soya idli are cooked.
1. If nothing sticks then the soya idlis are perfectly steamed.
1. Now you can remove the soya idlis from the steamer.
1. Have a small bowl filled with water.
1. Dip a spoon in the water and then scoop the soya idli out starting from the edges.
1. Dipping the spoon in water helps in the easy removal of idli from the plates.
1. The wholesome high protein soft soya idli are now ready to be served for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
1. Serve High Protein Soya Idli Recipe with Coconut Chutney, Tomato Onion Chutney, Thakkali Vengayam Sambar, Idli Milagai Podi & Filter Coffee for a delicious breakfast at home.
