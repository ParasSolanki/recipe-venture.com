1. Drizzle some oil on top of pasta and make sure to coat all of the pasta with the oil In a mixer, add mint leaves, coriander leaves, chilies, lemon juice, salt and grind into a smooth paste.
1. In a non-stick pan, add olive oil, minced garlic and sauteâ€™ them for 2- 3 minutes until the garlic has browned.
1. Now add the freshly ground Pudina Chutney and saute for 5-6 minutes until the raw smell goes off.
1. Add the cooked pasta to the pudina chutney and mix until all the pasta is coated well with the chutney.
1. Add salt and pepper according to your taste.

1. You can also cream to give the Pasta In Pudina Chutney a creamy texture.
1. Garnish the Pasta in Pudina Chutney along spring onions or parsley and serve.
1. Serve the Pasta In Pudina Chutney with a slice of Garlic Bread and a Summer Lettuce Salad Recipe for a quick weeknight dinner.
