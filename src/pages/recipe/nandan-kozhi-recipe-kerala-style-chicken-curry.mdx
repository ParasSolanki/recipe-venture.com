- 1 inch Cinnamon Stick (Dalchini).
- 500 grams Chicken - curry cut.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Nandan Kozhi recipe, firstly heat oil in a large heavy bottom pan heat oil on medium flame.
1. Add onions, ginger, and garlic and sauté till the onion is deep brown and well cooked.
1. While the onions are being sauted, in a separate pan, on slow flame dry roast the grated coconut to a golden brown colour.
1. Add the whole spices - cloves and cinnamon , mix well and turn off the heat.
1. Keep aside to cool slightly.
1. This is will also help in dry spices infusing some of their flavour in the roasted coconut.
1. Once cool, grind to a smooth paste using little water.
1. Once the onions have turned deep brown, add the dry spices - chicken masala, turmeric powder, chilli powder, salt and sauté for one minute.
1. Add tomatoes and fry till the oil separates.
1. Add the coconut and spice paste along with chicken pieces, mix and sauté till the chicken is well coated with spices.
1. Add about 1 cup water and cook covered on low flame for about 15 to 18 mins or the chicken pieces are cooked thoroughly.
1. Garnish it with curry leaves on top and it is ready to be served.
1. Serve Nandan Kozhi  as a Sunday brunch along with appam or Kerala Style Whole Wheat Parotta Recipe and Seer Fish Fry Recipe by the side to enjoy your meal.
