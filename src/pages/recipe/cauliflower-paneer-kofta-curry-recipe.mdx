### Instructions

1. To begin making Cauliflower Paneer Kofta Curry Recipe place big pot on the heat.
1. Add 1 liter of water into the pot and bring it to a boil.
1. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the boiling water and turn off the heat.
1. Next, to chop up the cauliflower, first remove the stem and leafy parts of the cauliflower and immerse it into the just-boiled, hot water.
1. Allow the cauliflower sit for about 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Then remove it from hot water, and place it on a kitchen towel.
1. Pat it dry completely.
1. Now grate the cauliflower completely and set it aside for a while.
1. After about 10 minutes, cauliflower would have released a lot of water, squeeze it out and discard the water.
1. Next, heat a pan and dry roast the grated cauliflower until it feels completely dry and contains no more moisture.
1. While roasting it, take care not to cook it too much.
1. It should not change to brown, so it is best to roast it on a low flame.
1. Once the cauliflower is completely dry, take it off the heat, transfer it into a cool dish and allow it to come down to room temperature.
1. Add the grated paneer to the cooled cauliflower.
1. Add in the mashed potatoes, and all the spices along with corn flour.
1. Knead well until everything is mixed.
1. Make small lemon sized balls of the mix and arrange them on a plate.
1. Set them aside till further use.
1. Next, we need to fry the koftas.
1. Warm some oil in a pan, when oil is hot enough, deep fry the koftas until evenly golden brown.
1. For an oil-free version, you could also bake them in a pre-heated oven, or use a kuzhi-paniyaram pan to pan-fry them.
1. Either way, lay the golden brown koftas onto kitchen paper once they are browned on all sides.
1. To prepare the curry, first warm some oil or butter in a pan.
1. Add the shahi jeera and fry for a minute.
1. Next add the finely chopped onions and fry them till translucent.
1. Add the tomato puree and cook it together until the puree thickens and begins to leave the sides of the pan.
1. At this stage, add all the spice powders and mix well.
1. Then add water as required and bring the curry to boil.
1. Turn the heat down, add the cream, mix well and finally add the fried kofta balls.
1. Simmer on low heat for about 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Turn off the heat, garnish the curry with the reserved cream and fresh coriander leaves.
1. Serve Cauliflower Paneer Kofta Curry  with Phulkas, Dal Tadka and Chana Dal Pulao along with a Urad Dal Raita for a comforting, yet special homely meal.
