### Instructions

1. To start preparing for Sabuana Sandige | Fryums Recipe, soak sabudana in enough water for atleast 5 hours or overnight.

1. Bring about 4 cups of water to boil in a thick bottom vessel or a pressure cooker.
1. Add soaked sago mixed with spice to the boiling water and mix well.

1. Now start spooning the mixture when it is still hot.
1. Using a small ladle/spoon, pour the sago mixture on the sheet to make small circles of about 1- 1.
1. 5-inch diameter.
1. Let these fryums get dried under the bright sun for 1-2 days.
1. After a day or two, sabakki sandige starts peeling off and looks transparent.

1. Once the fryums are completely dried, store them in an airtight container.
