### Instructions

1. To begin making Mawa Gujiya Recipe, add saffron to warm milk in a bowl.
1. Set it aside for 15 minutes.
1. The next step is to make the filling for Gujiya.
1. Crumble or grate the khoya/mawa.
1. In a thick bottom pan add the khoya/mawa and roast it on low flame till it changes colour to light brown (approximately 25 minutes or so).
1. Next, add desiccated coconut and roast further for 2 minutes.
1. Add almonds and pistachios to the khoya/mawa, mix well, remove from the heat and keep aside.
1. When the roasted khoya/mawa is still warm, add sugar and mix it well.
1. Set it aside.
1. Be careful towards the end of the roasting process so that the khoya/mawa does not turn too dry.
1. It should be moist yet a little brownish in colour)Next, we will prepare the dough for Gujiya.
1. While you wait for the khoya/mawa to cool, make the dough.
1. In a bowl, mix together maida, semolina, sugar and baking soda.
1. Add ghee and start rubbing the flour mix with the tip of your fingers.
1. Add water gradually and as much as required to make medium soft dough.
1. Knead the dough for 2 minutes until smooth.
1. Divide the mawa gujiya dough in two parts and make two neat balls.
1. Set aside for half an hour covered with a moist cloth so that the dough does not dry out.
1. Finally, we will stuff the Mawa in Gujiya.
1. Preheat the oven at 180 degrees C.
1. Thinly roll one ball and use a cookie cutter to cut out dough in the desired shape.
1. Gujiyas are usually semi circle but you can also use a cookie cutter for different shapes.
1. Roll the dough in a rectangular shape.
1. Trim the edges.
1. Cut it lengthwise wide enough to to place the mawa filling.
1. Cut these rectangular strips further to a squares of equal size.
1.  Line two baking trays with parchment paper.
1. Place each cut out square dough on the baking tray at an inch distance.
1. Scoop one heaped teaspoon of cooled mawa filling in the centre of each square dough and cover with another layer of square dough cut out.
1. Seal the sides of the mawa gujiya all around by pressing the edges with a fork.
1. Repeat this process till all the gujiya dough is used and filled.
1. Brush the top of the gujiya with milk or beaten egg and sprinkle flaked almonds.
1. Bake in the oven for approximately 15 minutes or till it begins to just turn golden brown.
1. Remove from the oven and let them cool over a wire rack.
1. Alternatively, you can also prepare the square gujiyas with the filling and deep fry the gujiyas in oil.
1. Once the mawa gujiya is baked or fried, keep them aside.
1. To make the sugar syrup, add water to a saucepan and bring it to a boil.
1. Once the water has boiled, lower the heat, add the sugar and stir continuously.
1. Once the sugar has melted completely, add the saffron mixture, give it a good stir for a minute and turn off the heat.
1. While the Mawa Gujiyas are warm, brush them with the saffron sugar syrup or you can even dip them in it.
1. Once the Mawa Gujiyas are completely cooled down, the syrup will add a nice glaze to them.
1. Serve these Mawa Gujiyas during Holi or Diwali along with a glass of Thandai and with a delicious plate of Dahi Vada.
