### Instructions

1. To begin making the Lobia Kebabs Recipe (Black Eyed Bean Patties), we will first first wash the black eyed beans well and soak with fresh water overnight.
1. Once the black eyed beans are soaked well, cook the beans until the beans are soft and mashable.
1. You can use a sauce pan or the pressure cooker to cook the beans.
1. If you are using the pressure cooker, cook until you hear two whistles.
1. After two whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes and then turn off the heat.
1. If using a pressure cooker, cook until the first whistle, then turn off the heat.
1.  Allow the pressure cooker to cool off naturally.
1. Once cooled, drain the excess water and keep the beans aside.
1. Meanwhile, powder the rolled oats in a grinder and keep this ready.
1. Add the cooked beans to a bowl, keeping a few tablespoons aside.
1. Mash the beans using a potato masher or a fork.
1. Add powdered oats, finely chopped onion, garlic, fresh coriander, mint, red and yellow peppers and the unmashed beans together in a large mixing bowl.
1. Mix well, adding salt to taste as also cumin powder, red chili powder and garam masala powder.
1. Using your clean hand mix everything well, bring it together, mashing slightly.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. The next step is to shape and cook the kebabs in a pan.
1. Divide the mixture into medium patty size portions of 2 inch thickness and diameter.
1. Heat a skillet on medium heat.
1. Add a teaspoon or two of oil, spread this all over the skillet using a clean absorbent kitchen towel, in such a way as to coat the surface well, but not visible.
1. Place the shaped black eyed bean kebabs on the skillet.
1. Drizzle a few drops of oil all around the kebab.
1. Cook the kebabs on medium heat.
1. After about 2-3 minutes or after the under-side turns brown, flip carefully using a flat spatula.
1. Again cook for 2-3 minutes or until brown and crisp on both sides.
1. Transfer the Black Eyed Bean Kebabs to an absorbent paper towel.
1. Repeat the same process with the rest of the mixture.
1. Serve the Lobia Kebabs Recipe (Black Eyed Bean Patties) hot along with a Yogurt Dip for parties or as a snack for kids school boxes.
