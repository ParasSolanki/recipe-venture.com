### Instructions

1. We begin making the Konkani Style Patholi/Kadubu Recipe by soaking the rice in water for about 1 hour before you start using it.
1. Once soaked, drain the water and grind it along with flattened rice and coconut to form a lightly smooth mixture.

1. Take the mixture out and keep it in the refrigerator till you do the stuffing.
1. Heat a saucepan, add in the freshly grated coconut and jaggery, and 2 tablespoon water.
1. Pound the cardamom and add it into the mixture.
1. Allow the jaggery to melt and then let it become thick and sticky.
1. Heat a steamer with water on a low flame and keep it aside.
1. Meanwhile, take out the butter paper cut into a 10 centimeter square.
1. Take the rice mixture out and by using your hand take some mixture and pat them flat and little thick and round.
1. Spoon the sweet stuffing and place it to one end, make sure you do not over fill it.
1. Fold over the butter and close the dumpling to form a semi-circle.
1. Fold the butter paper from the sides carefully and you can as well tie it lightly with a thread or leave lightly folded and place it inside the steamer.
1. Repeat the process for the remaining as well.
1. Serve the Konkani Style Patholi/Kadubu Recipe after a nice meal of  Solkadhi Recipe  and Kadgi Chakko Recipe  with hot steam rice.
