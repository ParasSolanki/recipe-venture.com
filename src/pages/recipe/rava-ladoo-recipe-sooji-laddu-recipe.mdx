### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1/4 cup Cashew nuts - roughly halved.
- 1/4 cup Raisins.
- 1/2 cup Ghee - plus more if required.
- 1 tablespoon Ghee.
- 3/4 cup Sugar - finely powdered.
- 2 cups Sooji (Semolina/ Rava) - semolina.
- 1/4 cup Dessicated Coconut - (dry fine variery).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Rava Ladoo Recipe, we will first heat a teaspoon of ghee in a small pan on low heat; roast the cashew nuts until lightly golden and crisp.
1. Once roasted add in the raisins and saut√© for a few seconds.
1. Turn off the heat and keep this aside.
1. Preheat a pan over medium heat and roast the rava/sooji/ semolina for about 4 to 5 minutes until you get a roasted aroma.
1. Ensure it does not brown and burn.
1. Once the sooji is roasted, turn off the heat and keep aside.
1. Into a mixer grinder, add the sugar and blend to make a fine powder.
1. Add the roasted sooji/rava, dessicated coconut, elaichi powder to the powdered sugar and blend to make a coarse powder of the entire sooji mixture.
1. Powdering the rava/sooji will a little will give a better texture and good bite for the rava ladoo.
1. Into a large mixing bowl, add the sugar, rava, coconut mixture, roasted cashew nuts and raisins.
1. Give the mixture a stir.
1. Add the melted ghee and combine it well together.
1. Shape the rava ladoo mixture into 20 equal size balls.
1. The entire mixture should be warm, if the rava mixture has cooled down, then it will not be able to hold firm into a ball.
1. If you are unable to hold the mixture and shape it into a ball; add in a tablespoon of milk or ghee or both to help it come together.
1. You have to ensure the you compress the rava ladoo mixture effectively with your fingers to bring it together.
1.  As you keep compressing the rava ladoo, it will get more and more firm and you will be able to shape it into a ball.
1. Once you have shaped all the Rava Ladoos, they are ready to be served.
1. Store them in an airtight container for about 2 weeks.
1. Serve the Rava Ladoo as a dessert after your everyday meal of Punjabi Dal Tadka, Arbi Shimla Mirch Sabzi and Phulka with your family.
