### Instructions

1. To make Bhaat Na Rasawala Muthia Dhokla, prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.
1. Into a large mixing bowl, combine all the muthia dhokla ingredients and mash the rice well until it forms a dough like consistency.
1. Grease your palms, shape into small ovals (muthias) and keep aside.
1. For kadhi, into a sauce pan combine the dahi, besan, turmeric powder, salt and red chilli powder and mix well to combine until there are no lumps.
1. Add the 3 cups of water and bring to a brisk boil.
1. Keep whisking the Kadhi as it continues to boil, as this makes it smooth and creamy, thus giving it a perfect texture.
1. Once the kadhi has come together into a smooth and creamy mixture while it is boiling, turn the heat to low, add the ginger garlic, green chillies, cinnamon stick and simmer kadhi while we add the muthias.
1. Add the muthia into the kadhi.
1. Simmer for at least 5 minutes and you will notice the muthia‘s rising to the top and floating.
1. Once it begins to float to the top, simmer the Bhaat Na Rasawala Muthia Dhokla for another 2 minutes.
1. The final step is to prepare the tadka.
1. Heat ghee in a saucepan on medium heat; add the cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.
1. Stir in the curry leaves, cinnamon and give it a stir.
1. Gradually, add the seasoning mixture to the above Rasiya Dhokla/Bhaat Na Rasawala Muthia Dhokla and allow the mixture to come to a brisk boil and turn off the heat.
1. Serve the Bhaat Na Rasawala Muthia Dhokla as a one dish meal for any weeknight dinner when you are looking for a comforting meal.
