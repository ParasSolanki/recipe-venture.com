### Instructions

1. To prepare the Kerala Chicken Curry, in a mixing bowl, marinate the chicken with curd, turmeric powder and salt for about 2 hours.
1. To make the masala for the Kerala Chicken curry Heat a skillet on medium low flame and dry roast the peppercorns, coriander seeds, cinnamon stick, fennel seeds and dried red chilies.
1. This will take about 4-5 minutes.
1. Once the aroma of the spices begins to waft in the air, turn off the flame and allow it to cool down.
1. Transfer to a mixer jar and grind to a corse powder.
1. Heat oil in kadai/wok, add mustard seeds.
1. When it splutters, add onion and curry leaves.
1. Sauté.
1. When onions are lightly brown, add ginger, garlic, and sauté for a minute.
1. Add chicken, half of the freshly ground masala, and salt.
1. Mix them, add 1/2 cup of water, cover with a lid, simmer and cook till the chicken is almost done, for about 15 to 20 minutes at least.
1. Keep sautéing occasionally.
1. Once the chicken is cooked, add the oats and add 1-1/2 cups of more water and cook the chicken until the curry thickens a little (about 5 minutes).
1. Lastly, add the reserved half of the ground masala and give it a nice stir.
1. Keep it covered for 5 to 10 minutes before serving, to help the flavours combine well.
1. Serve Kerala Chicken Curry along with Kerala Style Appam Recipe (Without Yeast) and a side of Seer Fish Fry Recipe for a lip smacking Sunday lunch.
