### Instructions

1. To begin making the Prawns Theeyal recipe, start by taking grated coconuts in a blender and blending it so it becomes fine.
1. This will help the coconut to brown evenly and faster.
1. In a wok/kadhai, take coconuts and start roasting on medium flame.
1. Stir every 10 seconds to avoid burning.
1. Once the coconuts have achieved light brown colour add coriander seeds, red chilly, some curry leaves, 2-3 shallots, cumin seeds, fenugreek, turmeric powder and roast.
1. Once the coconut mixture is nicely roasted and achieved a deep brown colour take it off heat to cool.
1. Once cooled blend the mixture in blender.
1. First blend it to powder everything.
1. Then add the tamarind pulp and little water and blend.
1. Blend till it becomes a cohesive smooth paste.
1. In the same wok/kadai, heat some coconut oil.
1. Once hot, splutter some mustard seeds.
1. Add the remaining shallots and garlic and sauté till everything turns translucent.
1. Add curry leaves and sauté for another minute.
1. Add the coconut paste in and give a good mix.
1. Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil.
1. Add salt as per taste and let it boil until the oil starts appearing on top.
1. This will take 5-10 minutes.
1. Now add cleaned prawns and let it cook for 3-5 minutes before switching off the flame.
1. Serve Prawns Theeyal Recipe with hot steamed rice for a perfect weekday meal.
