### Instructions

1. To begin making the Carrots Dill and Peanut Sadam, in a pan, dry roast 3 tablespoons of peanuts, white til seeds, black til seeds, and red chilies until fragrant.
1. Once the nuts are toasted, turn off flame and set aside to cool.
1. In a mixer jar, add coconut along with all the toasted peanuts and sesame seeds.
1. Grind to a coarse mixture.
1. In a kadai, heat oil on medium flame.
1. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of peanuts, urad dal, chana dal, and fry till the peanuts are well roasted and the dal has turned golden brown on crisp.
1. Ensure you roast on low to medium heat.
1. Once roasted, add the curry leaves, saute for a few seconds and add the onions, and saute until the onions soften.
1. Once the onions soften, add the grated carrots and dill leaves, sprinkle some water and cover and cook for about 5 minutes until the carrot has softened.
1. Finally add in the ground peanut-til and coconut mixture, dill leaves and cooked white rice and give it a good stir.
1.  Add salt to taste and cover the pan and simmer so the Carrots Dill and Peanut Sadam will absorb all the flavors.
1. After about 3 to 4 minutes of simmering, turn off the heat and serve.
1. Serve Carrots Dill and Peanut Sadam with Sweet & Spicy Coriander Tadka Raita and Elai Vadam for a simple and lovely weekday lunch.
