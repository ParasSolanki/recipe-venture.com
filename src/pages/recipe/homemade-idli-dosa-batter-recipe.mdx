### Ingredients

- 1-1/4 cups White Urad Dal (Whole).
- Water - for soaking.
- 3 cups Idli Rice.
- 2 teaspoons Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Homemade Idli Dosa Batter, soak the rice in water, such that the all the rice is completely immersed in water.
1. Let it soak for about 6 hours.
1. Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water.
1. Let it soak for about 6 hours.
1. First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter.
1. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter.
1. The batter will look fluffy.
1. Pour this batter into a large container.
1. Grind the rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter.
1. Adding too much water will make the dosa batter too watery.
1. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .
1. The rice batter is a little coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.
1. Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments.
1. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.
1. Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.
1. Note on fermenting the Idli Dosa BatterFermenting has to take place where the weather is warm.
1. So ideally summerâ€™s the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity.
1. But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven.
1. If your oven has light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven.
1. Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment.
1. If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment.
1. This process can be mastered with experience.
1. Method For making idlis from the Idli Dosa BatterThe freshly fermented batter is great for making idli's.
1. So typically and traditionally, the first day after the rise, we made idli's at home and there after it is great for making dosa's as well.
1. For making idlis do not dilute the batter with water.
1. When making dosa's you can optionally dilute the batter with a little water to help in easy spreading.
