- 5 tablespoon Sugar.
- 1 cup Jackfruit Ripe (Kathal) - seeds removed and chopped.
- 2 Cardamom (Elaichi) Pods/Seeds - powdered.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Kerala Style Chakka Adai Recipe, chop the jackfruit flesh and add it in a sauce pan with ¼ cup water and boil it till it gets soft and mushy.
1. In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients - rice flour, fresh coconut, sugar, salt and powdered cardamom pods including the cooked jackfruit and add little water and knead it to form a soft and firm Chakka Adai dough.
1. Add a little ghee to the dough, mix it in well and cover with a muslin cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.
1. Meanwhile heat a tawa over medium heat.
1. Take a plastic sheet to flatten the Chakka Adai.
1. Divide the dough into 6 - 8 equal portions.
1. Use a plastic sheet to flatten these Adais, grease the sheet  with some oil and take one Chakka Adai ball and pat it on the sheet, grease your fingers with oil to do this, pat until you get an adai of medium thickness, ensuring it is evenly shaped.
1. Place the Chakka Adai on the preheated tawa, carefully lifting off the paper off before placing it on the skillet.
1. Drizzle a little bit of oil along the edges and the centre of the chakka adai and allow it to sizzle and crisp up.
1. When it seems half cooked, flip the adai over with a spatula to cook the other side.
1. Cook well till you have brown patches on both sides.
1. Then, take the adai off the skillet, add a dollop of butter or ghee, and serve.
1. Serve the Kerala Style Chakka Adai Recipe as a snack with a glass of Muskmelon (Kharbuj) Juice Recipe for your evening snack or even as your breakfast.
