### Instructions

1. To begin making the Palak Mushroom Makhani Recipe, we will first steam the washed and chopped spinach.
1. Add the chopped spinach, tomatoes, green chillies, ginger and garlic into the pressure cooker, add 2 tablespoons water and pressure cook for one whistle.
1. After the first whistle, release the pressure immediately by running it under cold water.
1. This helps to retain the fresh green color of the spinach/ palak.
1. Once cooked allow the palak to cool completely and then pulse it in your blender, with almost no water.
1. You can also choose to mash the spinach with a masher to give it a different texture as well.
1. Melt the ghee in a frying pan on medium heat; add cumin seeds and the cinnamon stick.
1. Saute the ingredients for a few seconds.
1.  Stir in the turmeric powder and saut√© for a few seconds and add the mushrooms.
1. Roast the mushroom, along with a little salt until just about cooked.
1. Stir in the garam masala as well and saute for a few seconds.
1. Once the mushrooms are cooked, add the cooked palak puree, the fresh cream, any more salt if required.
1. Give the Palak Mushroom Makhani a brisk boil for about 2 to 3 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Transfer the Palak Mushroom Makhani to as serving bowl and serve hot.
1. Serve the Palak Mushroom Makhani Recipe along with hot Phulkas smeared with ghee, Jeera pulao and a raita for lunch or dinner.
1. You can also pack the Palak Mushroom Makhani Recipe along with Phulkas into a kids lunch box.
