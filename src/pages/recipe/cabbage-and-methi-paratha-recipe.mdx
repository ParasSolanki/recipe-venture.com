### Ingredients

- 3 cups Instant Oats (Oatmeal) - (oat bran).
- 1/3 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt).
- 2 teaspoons Sunflower Oil.
- Salt - to taste.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 1 cup Cabbage (Patta Gobi/ Muttaikose) - finely chopped.
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- 1/2 teaspoon Ajwain (Carom seeds).
- 1 cup Whole Wheat Flour.
- 150 grams Methi Leaves (Fenugreek Leaves) - finely chopped.

### Instructions

1. To prepare Cabbage and Methi Paratha, first finely chop the cabbage, methi and onion.
1. Heat oil in a stir-fry pan over medium heat and saute the onions till they turn soft.
1. Add the cabbage and cook covered till soft.
1. Turn off the heat and let the vegetables cool down.
1. To bind the dough for the paratha, combine together whole wheat flour, oat bran, cabbage, methi leaves, curd and spices and bind the dough using a little water if needed.
1. Knead the dough well for few minutes.
1. Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes, this helps the dough to soften.
1. Divide the dough in small size equal parts.
1. Roll out each portion into a round parantha to a prefered thickness.
1. Do make sure you keep dusting it in flour, so the the paratha does not stick to the surface while rolling.
1. Preheat the tawa (griddle) on medium heat.
1. Place the rolled out dough on the heated tawa and cook on medium heat both sides till it is slightly browned.
1. When you notice the brown spots, smear a teaspoon of ghee or oil on both sides and cook until the paratha has turned golden brown and lightly crisp on both sides.
1. Once the paratha is done, place it on a platter and proceed to cook the remaining parathas.
1. Serve Cabbage and Methi Paratha with Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita and Mango Pickle.
