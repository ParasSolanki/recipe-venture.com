### Instructions

1. To begin making Sprouted Ragi Chicken Cutlet Recipe, partially cook the chicken for about 10 minutes in a kadai with enough water, cool it and grind with some salt and pepper.
1. I did not grind to a fine paste.
1. Also cook potatoes and carrots in a vessel till they are cooked al dente.
1. Once done, drain all the water which you can later use as a vegetable stock for other gravy recipes or soups.
1. Coarsely grind the sprouted ragi in a mixer grinder.
1. Preheat a convection oven to 200 degrees.
1. Prepare a baking dish, grease it well such that the cutlets won't stick when baked.
1. Or you can also grease a parchment paper and line it on the baking sheet.
1. Mash the boiled potatoes and carrots, add the ground ragi and chicken, add chopped onions, ginger and garlic paste, green chilies, garam masala, black pepper, roasted cumin powder, coriander leaves and oats.
1. Combine everything well, add more oats if the mixture feels it has more moisture.
1. Give shape to the cutlets and place them on a greased baking dish, drizzle some oil on the top and bake in a preheated oven at 200 degrees for 15 minutes and grill for 10 minutes or till cooked and looks crisp from outside.
1. Enjoy the hot and crispy sprouted ragi chicken cutlet.
1. Serve Sprouted Ragi Chicken Cutlet Recipe along with Dhaniya Pudina Chutney Recipe and Date and Tamarind Chutney Recipe along with Indian salad like Kachumber Salad Recipe and Adrak Chai Recipe for a small tea party at home with your close friends and family.
