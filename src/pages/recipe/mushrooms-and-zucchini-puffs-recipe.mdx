### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mushrooms & Zucchini Puffs, we will firstly make the puffs pastry.
1. In a bowl, add flour and salt.
1. Give it a mix.
1. In a separate bowl, add the lemon juice to the cold water and keep aside.
1. Now, add the frozen grated butter to the flour and mix it quickly with the help of a fork.
1. Do not use your hands, otherwise butter will start melting.
1. Start adding the cold water, a tablespoon at a time, and keep mixing with the fork.
1. Then bring it all together with your hands.
1. You will have a big rough ball of dough.
1. Put the dough on a flat surface and lightly pat it with your hand.
1. Then wrap it in a cling film and keep it in fridge to rest for a minimum of 1 hour.
1. You can prepare this dough in advance also.
1. You can keep it in the fridge for up to 3 days and up to 2 months in the freezer.
1. The next step is to make the filling.
1. In a non- stick pan, heat a teaspoon of oil and then add chopped mushrooms, zucchini, and a teaspoon of salt.
1. Sauté it for about 5-10 minutes or until the water released from the vegetables dries up.
1. Take the vegetables from the pan, pu it in a bowl and keep aside.
1. Now, in the same pan, add butter and as soon the butter heats up, add garlic and onion.
1. When the onion becomes golden brown, add the sautéed mushrooms and zucchini.
1. Next, add salt and thyme, and cook for a minute.
1. Remove from heat and keep aside to cool down.
1. The final step is to prepare the puffs.
1. To begin with, put your oven on preheat at 200°C and line your baking tray with parchment paper.
1. Next, add egg and milk in a bowl and lightly beat it to prepare the egg wash.
1. If you don’t want to use egg, then you can use only milk.
1. Now, take out the prepared dough from the fridge and pat it down on a lightly floured surface.
1. Using a rolling pin, roll it out to the thickness of a chapati/roti.
1. You can use dry flour whenever the dough starts sticking to the surface.
1. For easier handling, you can take half of the prepared dough at a time as it will be easier to roll out.
1. Using a round utensil, cut out the round shapes from the rolled out dough.
1. I used a 5-inch bowl to cut and it made around 13-14 puffs.
1. Now, on half portion of the cut out sheets, first put some grated cheese.
1. Then spread the cooled prepared filling on top of the cheese.
1. Make small cuts on the other half and then fold it over to close the puff.
1. Using a fork, press the edges of the puffs to seal them properly.
1. Now, lightly brush the puffs with egg wash/milk wash and sprinkle sesame seeds on top.
1. Put the prepared puffs on the baking tray and bake at 180°C for about 25 minutes or until the puffs become golden brown.
1. Serve Mushrooms & Zucchini Puffs Recipe along with some Tomato Ketchup and hot cup of Masala Tea as an evening snack or at your tea or Kitty parties.
