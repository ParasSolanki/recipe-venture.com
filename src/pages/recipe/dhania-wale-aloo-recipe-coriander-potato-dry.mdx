### Instructions

1. To begin making the Dhania Wale Aloo Recipe, wash and boil the baby potatoes in a pressure cooker to two whistles (until they are cooked yet firm), peel and keep aside.
1. Also, dry roast sesame seeds in a pan in low heat to golden brown colour and keep aside.
1. Next, add all the ingredients mentioned in the 'Dhania Chutney' including coriander leaves, green chillies, ginger and grind it to a smooth paste with little water using a hand blender or mixer and keep aside.
1. Heat ghee in a heavy bottomed pan on low flame, add the cumin seeds powder, pepper, garam masala and sendha namak or rock salt.
1. Add the boiled baby potatoes and saut√© until they are mildly roasted in low heat.
1. This will take around 10 minutes.
1. Now, add the dhania chutney that we prepared earlier to the potatoes and give it a good toss.
1. Let the potatoes simmer for 10 minutes, occasionally stir in-between, until the potatoes are well coated by the masala paste.
1. Switch off the flame, add the lemon juice and give it a good toss.
1. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and serve hot.
1. Serve Dhania Wale Aloo along with Phulkas and Palak Raita for a weekday lunch or dinner.
