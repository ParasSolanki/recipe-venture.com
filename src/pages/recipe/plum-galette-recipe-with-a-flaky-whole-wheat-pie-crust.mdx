### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Butter - cut into cubes.
- 8 tablespoons Caster Sugar.
- 5 Plums - black or red.
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 1 cups Whole Wheat Flour.
- 1/2 cup All Purpose Flour (Maida).
- 3 to 4 tablespoons Chilled water.
- 2 tablespoons Corn flour.
- Vanilla Ice cream - or whipped cream to serve with.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Plum Galette Recipe, we will first have to get the pie dough ready and refrigerate it for a couple of hours.
1. First get all the ingredients ready for the pie dough and get your butter cut into small pea size pieces.
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar.
1. Add the butter into the flour mixture.
1. Work the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
1. When you hold the flour together, it should hold tight and when you let it loose, it will fall apart.
1. Sprinkle ice water onto the flour and butter mixture.
1. Using your hands push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together.
1. Make sure to add little water at a time, as the heat from your hands will melt the butter and help form the dough as well.
1. You can transfer the pie dough on to a work surface and knead the dough until all the flour has come together to form a smooth dough.
1. Once done, wrap the dough in a cling film or a plastic wrap and refrigerate it for a couple of hours.
1. This refrigeration process helps to give the pie crust a flaky texture.
1. Once refrigerated, we are now ready to roll the dough to form a crust.
1. Preheat the oven at 180 C and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or generously flour the baking sheet.
1. Get the plums cut to the desired size and get the remaining ingredients ready.
1. Place the dough on a generously floured surface and roll the pie dough into a 11 to 12 inch round.
1. Transfer the pie dough into the baking sheet.
1.  In a mixing bowl, stir together the corn flour, sugar and plums.
1. Spread this plum mixture evenly over the rolled out pie crust keeping the edges free for folding.
1. Once you have arranged the plums, fold the outer edge of the dough and cover part of the plums that are towards the edge.
1. You can decorate the edges by pleating them, using the fold technique.
1. Place the Plum Galette into the preheated oven, loosely cover with an aluminum foil and bake for about 35 to 40 minutes.
1. After about 35 minutes, you will notice the plum is bubbling.
1. At this stage, uncover the Plum Galette and bake in the open for another 5 to 8 minutes.
1. Once done and you notice the sides of the Galette is browned golden and crisp, remove from the oven.
1. Cool the Plum Galette, this process helps the plum mixture to become firm.
1. Serve the Plum Galette  along with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream as a party dessert.
