1. Preheat the oven at 220 degrees C for 10 mins.
1. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and spread the mushroom mix all over leaving some space between the mushrooms.
1. Do not overcrowd the tray as the pieces need some space to roast.
1. Place the tray into the oven and roast for 10-15 mins or till the mushroom starts turning deep brown in color.
1. You can increase the cooking time if you wish to have a blackish color on the mushrooms.
1. Take out the tray and allow it to rest for a few mins.
