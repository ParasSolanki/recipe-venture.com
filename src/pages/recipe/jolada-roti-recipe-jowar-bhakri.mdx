### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Rice flour.
- 1 cup Water.
- 1 teaspoon Sunflower Oil.
- 1-1/2 cup Jowar Flour (Sorghum).
- 1 teaspoon Salt.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Jolada roti, heat water in a pan and add salt and oil to the water.
1. Mix it well.
1. When it starts boiling, add the rice flour and mix continuously to avoid any lumps till all the water is absorbed.
1. Once the water is absorbed, turn off the heat and allow it cool for 5 minutes.
1. After 5 minutes, add the jowar flour to the cooked rice flour and knead well.
1. Keep adding little hot water at a time until the dough becomes soft and non-sticky .
1. Knead properly, as we will make the rotiâ€™s immediately without giving any resting time to the dough.
1. Keep the dough covered with clean damp cloth so that it does not dry.
1. The next step is to cook the rotis.
1. Keep a iron tawa/griddle on medium flame.
1. Dust your rolling surface with little whole wheat flour.
1. Now we will start making the rotis using our hands.
1. Divide the dough into 6 - 8 equal portions and roll out a portion of the dough into a round and thick roti using your hands.
1. You can shape the roti by pressing out a circle with your fingers as well.
1. Place the roti over the preheated skillet and cook it for a few seconds on one side or till a few bubbles appear on top.
1. Turn over the roti and cook the other side for a few more seconds.
1. Lift the roti with tongs and roast over the direct flame till brown spots appear on both the sides.
1. Similarly, prepare the remaining Jolada Rotis.
1. Serve Jolada Roti Recipe (Jowar Bhakri) along with Karnataka Style Badanekai Yennegai Gojju Recipe (Stuffed Brinjal Recipe), a bowl of Yogurt (Curd) and Uchellu Chutney for North Karnataka inspired meal.
