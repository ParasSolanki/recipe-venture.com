### Instructions

1. To begin making the Red Velvet Cake Recipe, preheat the oven to 180°C.
1. Grease and line the sides of a 6″cake tin with parchment paper.
1. Cream the butter in the bowl of the stand mixer until creamy.
1. Add the sugar and beat until the mixture is pale and fluffy.
1. For about 3 minutes.
1. Add the vanilla extract and the egg yolks, one by one, beating well after each addition till well combined.
1. Do not over beat.
1. That will curdle the mixture.
1. Sieve the flour, cornflour, baking powder and cocoa powder in a sieve resting on a plate.
1. Add the buttermilk with the food colouring and mix together.
1. It should be very red, so add more if you need to.
1. Sift one-third of the dry ingredients into the butter and eggs mixture and fold until just combined, then pour in one-third of the buttermilk mixture and mix until just combined.
1. Continue, combining a third at a time, until both are incorporated.
1. Whisk the egg whites and salt in a separate clean bowl until stiff peaks form.
1. Add 1/3rd to the batter and mix.
1. Add the remaining egg whites in three stages, folding them in gently with a spatula until just incorporated, without knocking off too much air from the egg whites.
1. In a small bowl, mix the vinegar and baking soda until it bubbles up, then gently fold this into the batter.
1. Quickly pour the batter into the prepared tin and smooth the top.
1. Bake in the oven for 25–30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean .
1. Rest the cake in the tin 15 minutes, then carefully remove the cake from the tin and cool it completely.
1. For the frosting, whip the heavy cream with 1/4 cup icing sugar till stiff peaks form.
1. Whip cream cheese with the remaining icing sugar in a separate bowl till smooth.
1. Fold in whipping cream and cream cheese together.
1. And now to assemble the Red Velvet cake.
1. Slice the cake into three equal parts.
1. Cut these slices equal to the diameter of the glass used for serving.
1. Layer the cake as the bottom most layer in the glass.
1. Pipe frosting on the cake evenly.
1. Place the next slices of cake and repeat it with frosting.
1. Top the Red Velvet Cake with some crumbs of the cake and serve.
1. Note: Instead of layers you can even crumble the cake and layer it in the glass.
