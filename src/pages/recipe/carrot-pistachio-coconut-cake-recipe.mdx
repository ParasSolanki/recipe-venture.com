### Instructions

1. To begin making the Carrot Pistachio Coconut Cake recipe, preheat your oven at 180 degree C for 10 minutes.
1. Prepare either two 9 inch round pans or one 10 inch bundt pan by coating with butter/oil and dusting with flour.
1. Now peel and finely grate the carrots and keep them aside.
1. Chop pistachios coarsely.
1. Do not make them super fine.
1. Slightly toast the shredded coconut over medium flame for about 2-3 minutes.
1. Do not brown them.
1. We just need to bring out crunchiness of coconut.
1. With the help of hand mixer, beat all the 4 eggs until they are frothy.
1. Slowly, add sugar and continue beating till the mixture doubles in volume and looks pale yellow (about 4 minutes).
1. Now add oil in the above mixture and then beat in the vanilla extract.
1. Mix it properly.
1. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and ground cinnamon in a bowl.
1. Add the flour mixture in the egg-sugar mixture and beat just until incorporated.
1. Finally, fold in the grated carrots, chopped pistachios and toasted coconut gently in the above batter.
1. If using 9 inch round pans, divide batter in the two pans equally and bake for 25-30 minutes or until toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
1. If using bundt pan, the time to bake will increase to about 30-35 minutes.
1. Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rackAfter about 5 to 10 minutes invert the cakes onto the wire rack and let it cool completely.
