### Instructions

1. To begin making the Cholar Dal recipe, wash dal under running water nicely till clear water appear.
1. In a pressure cooker, add dal with salt, turmeric, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon and water till the dal is immersed.
1. Pressure cook for 2 to 3 whistles as we don't want the dal to get mashed completely.
1. Once the dal is cooked, keep aside and prepare the tempering.
1. Heat ghee in a wok/kadhai and add cumin seeds and asafoetida, wait till cumin crackles.
1. Now add green chilies, ginger paste, raisins and saute for a while.
1. Add in the cooked dal and grated coconut and stir well.
1. Check salt again and adjust if required, cover the lid and cook for 10 to 12 minutes in low flame.
1. Once the dal is done, add a generous pinch of sugar along with some coconut slices before turning off the gas.
1. Serve hot and delicious Cholar Dal with fluffy Bengali Luchi for a perfect Bengali meal.
