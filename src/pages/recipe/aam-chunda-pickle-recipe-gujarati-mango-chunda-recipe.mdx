### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons Salt.
- 4 cups Sugar - 840 grams of sugar.
- 2 teaspoons Cumin seeds (Jeera) - roasted & crushed.
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder - optional.
- 5 cups Mango (Raw) - peeled and grated (1 kg of peeled and grated mango).
- 1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Aam Ka Chunda Recipe, wash the mangoes and dry them completely.
1. Peel the skin of the mangoes and then grate them.
1. Combine the grated mangoes, salt and turmeric powder and leave aside for 2 hours.
1. Once the mangoes have been marinated you will find that the mango has released some water.
1. At this point stir in the sugar little by little to the mango mixture continuously until all the sugar is nearly dissolved.
1. There are two different ways you can make this pickle.
1. Sun Method for the Chunda PicklePlace the mango mixture in the steel vessel with a rim.
1. Wrap the vessel with muslin or cheesecloth and tie it with a thick thread/lace to fit tightly around the vessel.
1. Keep it under sunlight for about 7 days or until the sugar and jaggery melts and reaches a double string consistency, stirring it well at the end of every day.
1. Bring it back inside once the sun sets.
1. Stir well the next morning and place it under the sun again.
1. Continue this process until the double string consistency has been reached.
1. Stove top method for Chunda PickleHeat a heavy bottomed pan on low heat; add the mango and sugar mixture to the pan and stir continuously until the sugar has dissolved completely.
1. You will find bubbles frothing up on the surface, but continue stirring until the sugar syrup reaches the single string consistency.
1. This takes about 5 to 8 minutes.
1. This step is crucial as over-cooking will make the sugar crystallize later.
1. Remove from the flame and let the mixture cool completely.
1. Continue stirring the chunda pickle while it is cooling occasionally to prevent the sugar from crystallizing.
1. Roast the cumin seeds in the pan until it starts crackling.
1. Coarsely pound it and keep aside.
1. Once the Mango Chunda pickle is cooled completely, stir in the chilli powder and crushed cumin seeds until well combined into the pickle.
1. The Mango Chunda Pickle can be consumed immediately.
1. Store the Mango Chunda Pickle in sterilized glass jars and it will last for about one year without refrigeration.
1. Serve Aam Ka Chunda Recipe with Thelpas or with just about anything on your plate.
