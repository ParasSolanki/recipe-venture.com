### Ingredients

- 1 cup Milk Powder.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1 cup Condensed Milk.
- 2 tablespoons Milk.
- 7 to 8 Saffron strands.
- 2 to 3 tablespoons Ghee.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Milk Peda recipe, soak saffron in milk for 10 to 15 minutes or refrigerate overnight for better colour results.
1. Heat ghee in a kadai and add condensed milk to it and allow it to cook on low flame till it comes a boil.
1. Now add powder milk and keep stirring vigorously to avoid forming lumps.
1. Break if any for smooth finish.
1. Keep stirring continuously till the mix starts to thicken.
1. Now add saffron infused milk and cardamom powder and stir nicely.
1. The mix will start to loosen, so keep stirring till it thickens back again.
1. Gradually the mix will start gathering and folding up leaving from the sides of the pan.
1. Carefully pinch a lime size ball and roll between your greased palm.
1. Be careful as the mix may be too hot to handle.
1. If the mix forms a dough and rolls into a smooth ball, that means it is ready.
1. But if you find the mix sticky then stir and cook on low heat for another 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Once the mix is ready, turn off the gas and remove the pan from the stove.
1. Set aside to cool.
1. When the mix is warm, grease your hands with ghee and pinch a lime sized ball, roll and flatten to shape into a disk.
1. Make impressions on it with a flower stencil or just keep it simple by making a dimple with your index finger in the centre.
1. Garnish/ decorate with chopped pistachios (optional) or saffron strands.
1. Serve Milk Peda to your friends and family during festivals and special occasions.
