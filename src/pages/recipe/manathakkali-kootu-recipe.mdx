- 1 Tomato - finely chopped.
- 1/4 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.

- 1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Manathakkali Kootu Recipe, we will first wash and clean the moong dal.
1. Place the moong dal into the pressure cooker along with the onions, tomatoes, garlic, chilli powder, turmeric powder, salt and about 1 cup of water.
1. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and cook until you hear a couple of whistles.
1. After a couple of whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. While the pressure is releasing, place the chopped Manathakkali Keerai into a steamer.
1. Steam until the keerai is cooked through.
1. Turn off the heat and take the keerai out of the steamer, so the color remains green.
1. Once the moong dal is cooked through completely, open the cooker and give the dal a quick whisk and take care not to mash the dal to much.
1. Kootu is usually a thick gravy along with vegetables where you can feel the texture of the dal.
1. Stir in the steamed Manathakkali Keerai.
1. Check the salt and spices and adjust to taste.
1. The next step is to season the Manathakkali Keerai Kootu.
1. Heat oil in a tadka pan, add the mustard seeds, urad dal and red chillies.
1. Allow them to roast and the dal to brown a little.
1. Stir in the asafoetida powder and turn off the heat.
1.  Pour this seasoning to the Manathakkali Keerai Kootu and serve.
1. Serve the Manathakkali Keerai Kootu along with Steamed Rice, Salad for a quick and healthy weeknight dinner or even for a quiet Sunday lunch with family.
