- 1 Onion - cut into chunks.
- 1 Chicken breasts - cut into cubes.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Spicy Lemon Chicken Kebab Recipe, thoroughly wash and clean the chicken, and cut them into cubes.
1. To marinate the chicken, in a mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces along with the bell peppers and onions and lemon juice, dried thyme, red chilli flakes, pepper powder, olive oil, salt and mix well.
1.   Rest it for at least for about 1 hour.
1.  Once it is well coated and marinated, start skewering by first placing the red bell pepper, a chicken cube followed by a onion chunk, repeating the sequence one more time.
1. Ensure the skewer is not over crowded and packed.
1. Heat a grill pan, drizzle some oil and place the skewers and cook for at least 25 minutes.
1. Keep brushing the extra marinade over the chicken and keep turning the skewers so that it is evenly cooked.
1. Serve the Spicy Lemon Chicken Kebab Recipe, along with tzatziki dip, sliced onions and green chutney to make it more interesting.
