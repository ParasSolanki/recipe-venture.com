### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Ghee.
- 2 tablespoons Raisins.
- 1 cup Milk.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1 Bay leaf (tej patta).
- 2 tablespoons Cashew nuts.
- 1/2 cup Sugar.
- 1 cup Sooji (Semolina/ Rava).
- 1 Saffron strands - few strands.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Bengali Mohan Bhog Recipe, we will first begin by boiling the water, milk, sugar, saffron and cardamom in a sauce pan and stirring until the sugar melts.
1. Keep the liquid mixture aside on simmer in another stove.
1. In wide heavy bottomed pan, heat 1/2 cup of ghee on medium heat; add the sooji and roast until the semolina gives out a roasted aroma and also turns light golden color.
1. Take care not to let it over brown.
1. Gradually, begin to stir in the hot milk mixture you prepared earlier.
1. Take care to keep the heat in medium as the mixture will splutter around as you pour the hot liquid to make the mohan bhog.
1. Keep stirring the mohan bhog mixture and allow the halwa to thicken.
1. Once the mohan bhog halwa has thickened it will begin to leave the sides of the pan.
1. Cover the pan and simmer for a couple of minutes stirring occasionally.
1. You will notice the mohan bhog halwa is cooked and when you stir the whole mixture comes away from the sides of the pan.
1. At this stage, turn off the heat, cover the pan with a lid and let it to rest for a few minutes.
1. In another small pan; heat the 1 tablespoon of ghee on medium heat; add the cashew nuts and raisins and roast them until the cashew nuts turn golden brown.
1. Turn off heat and stir this to the Bengali Mohan Bhog (Sooji Ka Halwa).
1. Serve the Mohan Bhog Recipe along with Luchi, Aloo Dum and Moong Sprouts Salad with Grated Carrots and Coriander for a special sunday lunch with family.
