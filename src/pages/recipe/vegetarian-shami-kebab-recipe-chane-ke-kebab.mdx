- 5 sprig Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - finely chopped.
- 2 tablespoons Gram flour (besan).

- 1 tablespoon Fennel seeds (Saunf).
- 1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Shami Kebab Recipe, we will first soak the chickpeas for at least 8 hours.
1. After the soaking period, cook the chickpeas along with salt until very soft.
1. If you press the chickpea between your fingers it should mash easily.
1. To cook the chickpeas, place the chickpeas in the pressure cooker, add salt and 3-Â½ cups of water.
1. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and pressure cook until you hear 5 to 6 whistles.
1. After 5 to 6 whistles, turn the heat to low the simmer for about 20 minutes.
1. After 20 minutes of simmering, turn off the heat.
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
1. The chickpeas will continue to cook under the pressure that exists in the cooker.
1. This will take another 15 minutes.
1. Once the chickpeas are cooked through completely, drain the excess water.
1. You can use the water in stocks or soups or even cooking rice.
1. We will now begin to make the Vegetarian Shami Kebabs.
1. Add the chickpeas into a food processor, along with the chaat masala, cumin powder, red chilli powder, fennel seeds, ginger, salt and mint leaves.
1. Pulse until you have a coarse batter.
1. Try to make a batter without adding any water.
1. Transfer the chickpea batter to a mixing bowl; add the mashed potato, paneer and gram flour into the Shami Kebab Mixture.
1. Combine it well into the mixture.
1. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.
1. Divide the mixture into 8 to 10 equal portions.
1. Shape the portions into round circular discs.
1. Our final steps is to cook the Vegetarian Shami Kebabs (Chane ke Kebabs).
1. To do that, preheat a pan and grease it with oil.
1. Place the shaped Kebab portions on the preheated skillet.
1. Drizzle a few drops of oil over the kebabs and pan fry them on both sides until lightly crisp and browned on both sides.
1. Proceed the same way to make the remaining Vegetarian Shami Kebabs and serve warm.
1. Place the Vegetarian Shammi Kebab (Chane Ke Kebab) on a serving platter and serve it along with Green Chutney.
