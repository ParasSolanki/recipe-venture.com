### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Salt.
- Water - as required.
- 2 tablespoon Ghee.
- 1 cup Jaggery.
- 2 cup Milk - divided.
- 1 cup Rice flour.
- 1 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1 cup Coconut milk.
- 2 tablespoon Fresh coconut - grated.

### Instructions

1. To begin with the Paal Kozhukatai Recipe, In a pan add jaggery and add a little water just enough to cover the jaggery in the pan.
1. Bring it to boil.
1. Take it off from the stove and let it cool a little.
1. Filter to remove any impurities in jaggery, keep aside.
1. In a nonstick pan add sieved rice flour, 1 cup milk, salt and water (as required) and whisk all together to get a lump-free, creamy consistency mix.
1. Now place the pan on a stove and cook on low flame with constant stirring until the rice mix turns thick and start leaving the sides of the pan.
1. You can add 1 teaspoon ghee to the pan to gather all the mix together.
1. Remove the thick rice paste onto a plate and let it cool for 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Grease your palm with ghee and pinch a tiny portion of the rice paste and roll into balls.
1. Repeat this for all the paste.
1. Keep the rolled kozhukattai covered with damp cloth to prevent it from drying.
1. In another pan, heat 1 cup milk and 1 cup water.
1. Bring it to boil.
1. Add the kozhukattai balls into the boiling milk.
1. Let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Very gently stir to prevent the balls from sticking to the bottom.
1. Once kozhukattai is cooked, it will float on top.
1. Now add filtered jaggery syrup, cardamom powder and give a gentle stir again.
1. Cover and boil for another 3 minutes.
1. Add coconut milk and give it a mix.
1. Wait for a minute and turn off flame.
1. Do not boil the milk once coconut milk is added.
1. If you boil after adding coconut milk, the milk will curdle.
1. Your paal kozhukattai is ready.
1. Garnish with few broken saffron strands (optional) before serving.
1. Serve it chilled or warm.
