### Instructions

1. To begin making the Cumin Spiced Potato And Leek Soup, we have to wash all the vegetables required to make the soup.
1. After cleaning the vegetables it is important to chop out the green ends and the roots of the leeks.
1. Slice the leeks and then chop them roughly to break them up a little.
1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into about 1/2 inch chunks, chop onions finely and set aside.
1. Now place a medium sized soup pot and heat olive oil.
1. Add chopped leeks and finely chopped onions to the pot and saute them until soft.
1. Once done add chopped potatoes and cook it for about 10 minutes on medium heat by covering the pot.
1. After the leeks and potatoes are softened add 3 cups of vegetable stock with 3 cups of water and salt to taste.
1. Now let it cook for about 30 minutes until the potatoes are completely boiled and the soup starts to smell delicious.
1. Take an immersion blender or you can use your normal blender to blend the soup.
1. Blend the soup in batches until you feel it is creamy and has uniform texture to it.
1. Pour Potato And Leek Soup into the serving bowl.
1. Now for the Cumin Spice, take a small pan and heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil and add red chilli flakes and cumin powder.
1. Allow the spice to sizzle for just 10 – 15 seconds and don’t let them to burn.
1. Sizzle this “tadka” over the soup in the bowl itself and serve.
1. Serve Cumin Spiced Potato And Leek Soup with slices of cheese garlic bread and Spaghetti Pomodoro Recipe (Pasta in Tomato Basil Sauce) for a complete meal.
