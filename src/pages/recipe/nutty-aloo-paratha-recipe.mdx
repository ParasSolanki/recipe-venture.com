### Instructions

1. To begin making Nutty Aloo Paratha Recipe,first knead the dough and keep it aside.
1. In a Mixing bowl, bring together wheat flour, water, and spinach puree (if using) to a soft pliable dough by kneading well.
1. Few drops of ghee or oil can be added if required.
1. To make the fillingIn a large mixing bowl add the  mashed potatoes or aloo, and all the other ingredients, crumbled paneer, coriander, garam masala, salt, jeera powder, red chilli powder/green chillies, chopped nuts, and raisins and mix them till they are well combined.
1. Divide the nutty aloo filling into 8 to 10 equal portions.
1. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of aloo paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.
1. The final step is to stuff the filling into the dough to make Nutty Aloo Paratha.
1. Roll the dough into a small circle, place the filling inside and close the dough from all sides.
1. Dust the filled aloo paratha dough in some flour and roll this stuffed nutty dough into a paratha, taking care not to let the stuffing ooze out.
1. preheat a roti tawa and  place the filled  nutty aloo paratha.
1. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.
1. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around.
1. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet.
1. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.
1. Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly.
1. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the nutty aloo parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.
1. Once the aloo paratha is cooked transfer to a plate.
1. Continue to the same process with the remaining parathas the same way.
