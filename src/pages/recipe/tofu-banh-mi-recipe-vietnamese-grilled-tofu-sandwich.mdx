1. Add all the vegetables into a bowl, add in chilli vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper and mix it well.
1. Rest the vegetables in the fridge until you finish making your grilled tofu for the Bánh mì.
1. Take a mixing bowl, add soy sauce, red chilli sauce, honey, pepper powder, ginger powder, salt a pinch and give it a mix.
1. Add in tofu slices and mix will and allow it to soak in the mixture for 10 minutes.
1. Heat a grill pan, once it is hot, brush the pan with some olive oil and place the marinated tofu pieces on to the grill.
1. Grill on each side for at least 5 minutes, until you notice brown grill marks on either side.
1. Once done, take the grilled tofu slices and place them on a plate.
1. Keep the pickled vegetables also out and we can start to assemble the Bánh Mì.
1. Cut the Baguette into a 6 inch length, cut it lengthwise on one of the sides in order to stuff in the fillings inside.
1. You can optionally toast the baguette along with butter or olive oil in the oven, to make it warm and more crisp.
1. Spread 2 tablespoon of mayonnaise evenly on the bread, and again spread about a tablespoon Sriracha sauce as well.
1. Layer the pickled vegetables over the bread and next place two grilled tofu slices one next to each other.
1. Place sliced cucumber and jalapeños neatly on top of the grilled tofu and finally garnish it with freshly washed coriander sprigs.
