### Instructions

1. To begin making the Pineapple Kesari Bhath Recipe, soak the saffron in a tablespoon of hot milk and keep aside.
1. Heat a tablespoon of ghee in a small skillet over medium heat.
1. Add the cashew nuts and allow it to roast until crisp and golden brown.
1. Add the raisins and saute until it puffs up and turn off the heat.
1. Keep this aside.
1. In a saucepan, cook the pineapple on low heat until it softens and gets well cooked.
1. Once done turn off the heat and allow it to cool.
1. Keep this aside.
1. In another saucepan; bring the remaining milk, 2 cups of water to a brisk boil.
1. Add the sugar, cardamom powder, saffron milk, camphor and turn the heat to low and keep it  simmering until we roast the rava (sooji).
1. In a heavy bottomed pan; heat 1/4 cup of ghee and add the semolina.
1. Roast the rava in the ghee on medium heat until you can smell a roasted aroma coming through and the rava becomes golden brown in colour.
1. After the rava has roasted, gradually add the milk mixture into the rava.
1. Keep stirring continuously as you add the milk so no lumps form.
1. Be careful when you add the boiling water and milk mixture as the rava bubbles up suddenly.
1. Keep stirring for at least 5 minutes until you notice the Kesari Bhath leaves the sides of the pan.
1. Once done, stir in the roasted cashew nuts and raisins and mix well to combine.
1. Transfer the Kesari Bhath to a serving dish and serve warm or chilled.
1. Serve the Pineapple Kesari Bhath along with Khara Bhath - Rava Upma for breakfast or any special occasion like wedding or a festival.
