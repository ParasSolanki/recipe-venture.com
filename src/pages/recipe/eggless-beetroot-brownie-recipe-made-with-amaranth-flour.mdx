### Instructions

1. To begin making the Eggless Beetroot Brownie Recipe Made With Amaranth Flour, first get all the ingredients prepped and ready.
1. Steam the beetroots using the steamer or a pressure cooker until very soft and cooked.
1. Once cooked, cool the beetroot and puree the beetroot.
1. Keep aside.
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/ 350F.
1. Line a 8 inch square pan with parchment paper or if using an aluminum foil, grease it with cooking spray.
1. The size of parchment paper or the aluminum foil should be big enough that later on, you can hold along the sides and take it out from the hot pan easily, carrying out the baked brownie for cooling.
1. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave oven, in a medium size bowl.
1. Heat on high for 1 minute and then mix it using a spoon.
1. Take care not to burn the chocolate.
1. Stir it well, it should be smooth.
1. In the same bowl, combine the beet puree, sugar, cocoa powder, unsalted butter, vanilla extract and mashed bananas and whisk it well.
1. I usually beat in a mixer at a low pulse for a minute or so till the mixture is smooth and creamy.
1. In a mixing bowl, sieve the amaranth flour along with baking powder.
1. Add the smooth and creamy beetroot mixture.
1. Add the chopped walnuts and salt.
1. Stir and mix the beetroot brownie batter well with a spatula but do not overbeat.
1. Pour the beetroot brownie batter into the prepared pan and bake for 35-40 minutes.
1. When done, the edges of the beetroot brownies will be visibly baked through and the center will be set (that is, not wiggly) when you shake the pan.
1. Try to look for the first sign of cracking on the brownieâ€™s top which should be shiny and set which means that the brownies are cooked and then pull them out.
1. Cool the beetroot brownies with amaranth flour completely in the pan on a wire .
1. After the brownies are completely cooled, after an hour, cut them into neat squares.
1. Serve the Eggless Beetroot Brownie along with a plate of Baked Potato & Peas Samosa with Phyllo Pastry and a hot cup of Masala Chai.
