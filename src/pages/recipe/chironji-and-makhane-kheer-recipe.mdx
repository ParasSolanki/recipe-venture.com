### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Jaggery.
- 1 teaspoon Ghee.
- 1/4 cup Raisins.
- 1 cup Phool Makhana (Lotus Seeds).
- Saffron strands - a few.
- 1/2 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).
- 1 tablespoon Badam (Almond) - sliced.
- 1 tablespoon Chironji.
- 1 liter Milk.
- 1/2 inch Cinnamon Stick (Dalchini).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Chironji & Makhane Ki Kheer Recipe, we will first roast the phool makhana in ghee until crisp and aromatic.
1. Heat a teaspoon of ghee in a heavy bottomed pan and roast makhana while continuous stirring until they become light brown and crisp.
1. Once done, remove from kadai and set aside to cool.
1. Coarsely grind half of the roasted makhana in a mixer grinder and keep aside.
1. We will use the remaining roasted makhana as a whole into the kheer.
1. Boil the milk in a heavy bottomed pan and condense the milk until it becomes just close to half.
1. Keep stirring occasionally to prevent the milk from settling into the bottom of the pan.
1. Once the milk is condensed, add the jaggery, the roasted Makhana (whole) and coarsely ground Makhana.
1. Mix well and cook on a medium flame for 5 to 10 minutes, while stirring occasionally until the kheer becomes thick and the makhana has absorbed and cooked through.
1. Add the saffron and nutmeg powder into the kheer, mix well and cook on a medium flame for another 3 to 4 minutes, while stirring occasionally.
1. While the kheer is cooking, heat a teaspoon of ghee into another small pan and roast all the dry fruits in it till lightly brown and you get a roasted aroma.
1. Add the half of the roasted dry fruits to the Makhane Ki Kheer and simmer for 3-4 minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Serve Chironji And Makhane Ki Kheer after your delicious festive meal of Jodhpuri Aloo, Ajwain Puri, Satvik Carrot Sprout Salad and Mirchi Ka Chunda.
