### Instructions

1. To begin making the Vegetarian Paella Recipe, first crush the saffron with a pinch of salt in a small mortar pestle and keep it aside for later use.
1. Next, proceed to make the sauce.
1. First, heat oil in the pan, till warm.
1. Then add onion and the garlic to it, and sauté for 1-2 minutes till the onions just turn pink.
1. Once the onions are pink/translucent, add the mushrooms and bell peppers to the pan and sauté them for 1-2 minutes more.
1. Cook till they are slightly softened.
1. Next, reserve some of these sauteed mushrooms and bell pepper slices to be used later as a garnish.
1. Continue to cook the remainder of the veggies in the pan.
1. Next, add the turmeric, smoked paprika and the tomato puree to it and simmer for a few minutes.
1. Next, add the stock, salt and the saffron and stir well.
1. Continue to simmer it until a few bubbles appear.
1. The next step is to add the rice to it, stir well and cover the pan.
1. Cook the rice till it is just cooked/al dente (about 12-15 minutes) and the water has been absorbed, leaving fluffy grains of rice.
1. If the rice dries up without getting fully cooked, you can adjust by adding stock as required to cook the rice till it is soft and fluffy, but not mushy.
1. When the rice is cooked, turn off the heat.
1. You can either serve the Paella in the same pot that you cooked it, or transfer ir into a serving dish or rice platter.
1. Garnish the paella with sliced mushrooms and peppers along with the olives.
1. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and arrange lime wedge.
1. Serve the Vegetarian Paella hot along with Watermelon Panzanella Salad.
