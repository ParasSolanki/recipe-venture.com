### Instructions

1. Method for KoftasHeat 1 teaspoon of oil in a pan; sauté the spinach on high heat until it gets soft enough and until all the moisture evaporates.
1. Turn off heat at this point.
1. Allow the spinach to cool completely.
1. Once the spinach cools, add the gram flour and salt to taste and combine well.
1. Divide the spinach into 8 equal portions.
1. Mix paneer, cumin powder and salt; divide into 8 balls and keep aside.
1. Take a portion of the spinach, flatten it on your palm and stuff the paneer balls in it.
1. Shape it into a ball (kofta).
1. While doing this, you might feel that the spinach mixture is not that pliable that it easily folds onto the paneer and makes a ball.
1. That's the right feeling.
1. It's not very easy to handle them.
1. If you feel the spinach does not cover the paneer properly, just patch the paneer all around with the spinach mixture.
1. It works!Roll each ball in over the breadcrumbs so they get coated evenly.
1. You can now cook the kofta's in the Oven or in the Kuzhipaniyaram PanIf you plan to use the Oven to bake the kofta's; then place the kofta balls on a greased baking sheet.
1. Brush the kofta balls with some oil and bake in a preheated oven (200 C) until the koftas turn golden brown in colour.
1. Remove the kofta's from the oven once baked and keep them aside.
1. If you plan to use the Kuzhipaniyaram Pan; then place the kofta balls in the pan's cavities; drizzle the kofta's with a little oil and pan fry them until golden brown on both sides.
1. You will have to flip the kofta balls so they fry on all sides evenly.
1. The next step is to make the Spinach Kofta CurryHeat oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add the grated ginger and sauté for a few seconds.
1. Stir in the tomato puree, turmeric powder, cardamom powder, garam masala powder, salt and chilli powder to taste.
1. Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for a couple of minutes till the tomatoes get cooked through.
1. Finally add the cream, honey and the Kasuri methi and stir it into the kofta curry.
1. Add in the pan fried palak paneer koftas, cover the pan and simmer until the curry and flavours get absorbed into the koftas.
1. Adjust the consistency of the palak paneer koftas by adding water if required.
1. Do make sure to check the salt and spice levels and adjust according to your taste.
1. Serve this delicious Spinach Paneer Kofta Curry along with Whole Wheat Naan Recipe or  Jeera rice of your choice for a quick and healthy weeknight dinner or even for parties.
