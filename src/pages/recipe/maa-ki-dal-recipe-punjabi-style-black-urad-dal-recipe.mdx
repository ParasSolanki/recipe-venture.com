### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Coriander Powder (Dhania).
- 1 cup Black Urad Dal (Split).
- 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera).
- 1 inch Ginger.
- 1 teaspoon Kashmiri dry red chillies.
- 1/2 teaspoon Garam masala powder.
- 1 tablespoon Rajma (Large Kidney Beans).
- 1 tablespoon Ghee.
- 4 Tomatoes.

### Instructions

1. To begin making Maa Ki Dal Recipe, first wash the dal and rajma well about 2-3 times and then soak them together in water for at least 8 hours or overnight.
1. The longer you soak the better it is for the texture of the dal.
1. Traditionally, the dals are soaked for 24 hours, changing water every 8 hours.
1. When you are ready to prepare the dal, after sufficient soaking time, take a heavy bottom pan (or a slow cooker) and bring 5 cups of water with a dash of salt, to boil in it.
1. Add the pre soaked dal and rajma to it and let it simmer till it cooks and turns a little soft.
1. This could take anywhere between 2-3 hours as the dal gets it flavours from the slow cooking process.
1. However, if you are in a hurry you can use the pressure cooker to hasten the process.
1. Next, add the tomato and ginger to the dal.
1. Once the dal is cooked, mash the dal and tomatoes a little bit.
1. Take care not to make it mushy, but just achieve a thick consistency.
1. Cook the dal for more 3 to 4 minutes.
1. In a small pan, warm some ghee, add the cumin seeds and saut√© till they turn slightly brown.
1. Add dry red chillies, coriander powder, garam masala powder and roast on a low heat for 1 minute taking care not to burn them.
1. Pour this tempering over the the dal and bring it to a boil.
1. Simmer it for another 10-15 minutes and serve hot.
1. Maa Ki Dal can be served with Baingan Ka Bharta, Boondi Raita and Phulka for a comforting Punjabi meal.
