### Instructions

1. To begin making Lab E Shireen Recipe, get prep with all the ingredients.
1. Make fruit based and flavour based jello of assorted color and keep aside (i used watermelon, pineapple and kiwi jellies).
1. Bring the milk to a rolling boil in a heavy bottomed saucepan.
1. Then add sugar and keep stirring continually on a medium heat, for another 10 minutes till all the sugar is dissolved and milk is condensing a bit.
1. In a bowl, remove a cup of milk from the boiling mixture, add drained rasgullas to it and keep aside.
1. Now to the boiling milk and sugar mixture, add colorful (optional but traditionally used) vermicelli and keep stirring on medium heat.
1. Let it boil for another 5 minutes or till the vermicelli is cooked.
1. When the vermicelli is almost done, dissolve the custard powder in about half a cup of water and add the mixture to the saucepan and turn the heat to medium low.
1. Add the grated Khoya to it too and keep stirring well at all times.
1. The mixture thickens considerably very soon now.
1. Once it is thick, switch off heat and let the mixture cool to complete room temperature.
1. Chill for 4 hours.
1. Now make jellies as per package instructions (if you are using homemade jellos but add only half the amount of water to each of it.
1. We need thick firm pieces which will hold their shapes when cut, when the jelly is ready.
1. Once the jelly is cooled or chilled you can chop it into big chunks or small bits as per preference and set aside.
1. AssemblingWhen custard is chilled, in a hand mixer, beat the fresh cream in a mixing bowl till it is light and fluffy.
1. Add all the cut fruits to the custard mixture and stir to combine.
1. (you can used canned fruits too, but make sure you drain the syrup before adding).
1. Fold in the whipped cream to the mixture along with roohafza , and fold to combine.
1. Place the dessert in your serving bowls, decorate it with the mixed chunks of jellies, milk soaked rasgullas.
1. Serve Lab E Shireen Recipe as a party dessert after a one pot meal of Arabian Chicken Mandi Recipe or Awadhi Style Chickpea Kofta Biryani Recipe.
