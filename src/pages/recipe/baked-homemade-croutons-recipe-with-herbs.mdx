### Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons Mixed Herbs (Dried).
- 1/3 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
- 1 teaspoon Garlic powder.
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt.
- 4 cups Whole Wheat Brown Bread - cut into cubes (regular loaf or baguette will work).

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Baked Homemade Croutons Recipe With Herbs, preheat the oven to 160 C.
1. In a large bowl, combine the bread, garlic powder, herbs and salt.
1. Drizzle olive oil over bread while stirring all the herbs and salt.
1. The olive oil helps the bread get coated with all of the salt and herbs.
1. Hence ensure you toss it gently and well until all the olive oil is absorbed.
1. Spread the herbed bread cubes into an even layer on a baking sheet.
1. Ensure you place them evenly spread apart on the baking sheet, and it's not crowded.
1. Place the herbed bread croutons into the preheated oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the bread has evenly crisped on all sides.
1. Toss it in between the baking process so all the sides get crisp well.
1. Once done, remove the Baked Homemade Croutons from the oven and allow it to rest at room temperature and cool down.
1. This cooling process helps the croutons get more crisp.
1. Once done, store the Baked Homemade Croutons With Herbs in air tight containers and use as required.
