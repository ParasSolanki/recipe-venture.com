### Instructions

1. To begin making the Mushroom Paratha Recipe, take all the ingredients meant for dough into a large mixing bowl.
1. Add a little water at a time to make a soft and smooth dough.
1. Cover the dough 30 minutes until we get the filling ready.
1. Next we will proceed to make the mushroom stuffing for the paratha recipe.
1. Heat oil in a wok or a kadai on medium heat.
1. Add the cumin seeds and allow it to crackle.
1.  Once the cumin seeds crackle, add onion and saute until the onions turns pinkish in colour.
1. Add the chopped green chilies, chopped chopped mushrooms and salt to taste.
1. Stir fry on high heat until most of the moisture from the mushrooms is evaporated.
1. Once the mushrooms have shrunk in size and the moisture has evaporated, add the garam masala and turmeric powder and give it a stir for a few minutes and turn off the heat.
1. Allow the mushroom paratha stuffing mixture to cool completely.
1. Divide the dough into 5 equal portions.
1. We will now proceed to make the stuffed mushroom paratha.
1. To begin making the paratha, keep a plate of dry flour for dusting.
1. We dust the dough in flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface.
1. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter circle.
1. Take a portion of the mushroom filling and place it in the center.
1. Next Gather the sides of the dough and bring them together.
1. Remove the little excess dough which popped out when you brought them together.
1. Press the filled dough down.
1. Dust the filled dough in some flour and roll it gently applying just a pressure.
1. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of dough and filling.
1. Preheat a Skillet/Tava on medium heat and place the filled Mushroom Paratha.
1. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.
1. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around.
1. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet.
1. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.
1. Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly.
1. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.
1. Once the paratha is cooked transfer to a plate.
1. Continue to the same process with the remaining Mushroom Parathas the same way.
1. Serve the Mushroom Parathas along with a spicy mango pickle for breakfast or a sunday brunch.
