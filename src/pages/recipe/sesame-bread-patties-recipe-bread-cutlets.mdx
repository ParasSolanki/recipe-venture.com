### Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon Black sesame seeds.
- 3 tablespoons Sesame seeds (Til seeds).
- Salt - to taste.
- Sunflower Oil - for shallow frying.
- 3 Green Chillies - finely chopped.
- 1 Onion - finely chopped.
- 1/2 teaspoon Sugar.
- 1 tablespoon Corn flour.
- 4 tablespoons Hung Curd (Greek Yogurt).
- 1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli powder.
- 1 Crusty bread log.

### Instructions

1. To begin making the Sesame Bread Patties (Cutlets) Recipe first prepare the sliced bread by trimming the sides.
1. In a bowl pour some water.
1. Dip 6 of the 10 bread slices into the water, immediately take them out and squeeze out as much of the water as possible.
1. Place the soggy bread in a bowl.
1. Over this, crumble the remaining slices of bread and mash it all up together to form a soggy dough.
1. To the dough add the hung curd, finely chopped onions and green chillies.
1. Mix well and sprinkle in the black and white sesame seeds, sugar, red chilli powder, salt and cornflour.
1. Mix it all together very well till it forms a mixture that is wet, but not so soggy that it cannot be easily handled.
1. Set the mixture aside for 10-15 minutes to rest.
1. Then divide it into 12-14 equal parts and shape them into small patties.
1. To shape the patties with ease, it may help to grease your palms with a little oil so that the batter doesn't stick.
1. The patties shouldnâ€™t be too thick, as that will make it take longer to cook and absorb too much oil.
1. Ensure that they are thin enough to cook easily and also hold shape.
1. Preheat a skillet on medium heat.
1. Place the patties on the skillet, drizzle some oil on the top and cook them evenly until golden brown and crisp on both sides.
1. Keep turning them around until they are golden on both sides.
1. Once done, remove the patties and place them on kitchen paper to drain the excess oil.
1. Serve the Sesame Bread Patties (Bread Cutlets) along with lime wedges, tomato ketchup or Salad and serve it for a weeknight dinner.
